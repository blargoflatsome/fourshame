          Muspella captures a darkweed infected orc named Batface Jim. From him
          they learn about a shadowman fort not far from their grove called
          Twisted Knife. The fort is controlled by another orc turned shadowman
          by the name of Braxxus, and the captains under his command Talon the
          Truth Seeker, and Rigor the Boar.


          Remi discovers a method of curing the darkweed infection, a spell called Greater Restoration. Howevever, the spell requires Diamond Dust. They use the last of Ancient Eunice's supply on Batface Jim in order to get him to talk.


          A were-rat goblin discovers the party on their path to Twisted Knife and offers them information in exchange for the tears they need to purify the tree of Corruption. They deceive the creature and learn that the Shadowmen are seeking a collapsed cave said to contain the body of Myrcella Roudgara's true born son and the vampiric childer of Torquil Von Demillo; Demetri.

          **A party divided**


          After the defeat of Braxxus and the fall of Fort Twisted Knife the party was given the choice of searching for the natural born son of Myrcella Roudgara or going with Ludwig the spriggan to purify the Blight Sister: Corruption.


          Unwilling to not do both; the, now warchief, Muspella took her barbarian warriors east to find the body of Tharon Roudgara. Hadrianna and Remi assembled a new party to head east into goblin territory to deal with Corruption.


          **Grip's Sudden but inevitable betrayal**


          Nate was contacted by a Grip, a green grung in hiding after his request for aid was denied by the Elder. Grip claimed that his people were under attack not only by the goblins but also 'Red Trees' with a taste for grung flesh. He also claimed to have contact with a man who could tell them how to find the Lost & Found in order to regain Remi's memories.


          The party agreed to aid his people in exchange for the information, but in the end, he attempted to lead them into an ambush. His betrayal was uncovered early, and after Hadrianna removed one of his arms, he agreed to help them ambush the ambush. Defeating the goblin were-rat Grung had attempted to betray them too, as well as the Red Trees. 


          So Grip made good on the information he promised and told them of a Necromancer living in an invisible tower on the way to the goblin city of Brown Water.
