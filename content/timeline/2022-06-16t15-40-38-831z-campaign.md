          Muspella captures a darkweed infected orc named Batface Jim. From him
          they learn about a shadowman fort not far from their grove called
          Twisted Knife. The fort is controlled by another orc turned shadowman
          by the name of Braxxus, and the captains under his command Talon the
          Truth Seeker, and Rigor the Boar.


          Remi discovers a method of curing the darkweed infection, a spell called Greater Restoration. Howevever, the spell requires Diamond Dust. They use the last of Ancient Eunice's supply on Batface Jim in order to get him to talk.


          A were-rat goblin discovers the party on their path to Twisted Knife and offers them information in exchange for the tears they need to purify the tree of Corruption. They deceive the creature and learn that the Shadowmen are seeking a collapsed cave said to contain the body of Myrcella Roudgara's true born son and the vampiric childer of Torquil Von Demillo; Demetri.

          **A party divided**


          After the defeat of Braxxus and the fall of Fort Twisted Knife the party was given the choice of searching for the natural born son of Myrcella Roudgara or going with Ludwig the spriggan to purify the Blight Sister: Corruption.


          Unwilling to not do both; the, now warchief, Muspella took her barbarian warriors east to find the body of Tharon Roudgara. Hadrianna and Remi assembled a new party to head east into goblin territory to deal with Corruption.


          **Grip's Sudden but inevitable betrayal**


          Nate was contacted by a Grip, a green grung in hiding after his request for aid was denied by the Elder. Grip claimed that his people were under attack not only by the goblins but also 'Red Trees' with a taste for grung flesh. He also claimed to have contact with a man who could tell them how to find the Lost & Found in order to regain Remi's memories.


          The party agreed to aid his people in exchange for the information, but in the end, he attempted to lead them into an ambush. His betrayal was uncovered early, and after Hadrianna removed one of his arms, he agreed to help them ambush the ambush. Defeating the goblin were-rat Grung had attempted to betray them too, as well as the Red Trees. 


          So Grip made good on the information he promised and told them of a Necromancer living in an invisible tower on the way to the goblin city of Brown Water.

      **Chapter 2**


      The party has settled into their new lives within Roudgara Forest but the threat of the shadowmen and the mysterious Lady of Thorns looms heavy over them.

    overview: Based on Torquill's Journal the event known as the Sundering may have
      taken place around this time. You have heard of this event from several
      ancient creatures. It has been claimed that during this event the Gods
      were banished and the world was tossed into chaos. Torquill's account
      suggests that he may have been involved in that event. He also names
      others, Chasm, and Soul Huntre.

      "In victory, we learn the short-sighted nature of the struggle. Let us be
      clear that no authority exists without serving a function. It is very
      important to understand what that is **BEFORE** you overthrow them!


      It would seem that without the bindings of flesh, or the tiring ache of entropy, the mouths of ghosts never grow weary. Chasm holds to Soul Huntre's plan and delights in the slaughter but how he can stand the mountain of dead that surely must bark at his heels, I have no idea. I only hope they find a solution soon, even the blood of this world tastes sad."

      "Something has gone terribly wrong and of course, Soul Huntre is nowhere
      to be found! Some great darkness is spreading across the sky, it is so
      much harder to eat when the cattle are spooked!


      Chasm be damned the dark elf still revels in this curse, so long as he has blood to spill. At least the void appears to take the ghosts with it. With each new world, I gain a temporary reprieve."

      "Gods be damned I dream of a world without fucking liches. Do I remain to
      die here or endure the indignity of being saved by a lich.... or do I
      chance the astral bridge? It's no wonder the Liches forsake their skin,
      this world confines me enough without all this flesh binding me even
      tighter."

      "Itâ€™s been a mere 130 years since we celebrated Soul Huntre's victory and
      how hollow a victory it has been. Still, The devourer has finally been
      satisfied. Better yet Skatvold had to sacrifice himself to fix our
      mistakes! I can't help but feel that the lack of a sunset was done to
      spite me, but I'll take the win. Time to find a way out of this world.


      I need to establish a kingdom if I'm to remain fed, these creatures can't seem to do much else but die and their blood is soured with fear and disease. A kingdom to pen the herd and breed sweeter stock is the only way."


      *\- from the journal of Torquill Von Demillo*


      Ludwig the Leprechaun claimed it was during this time, or perhaps before, that the Blight Sisters were created by his friend Tut. He did so due to an 'incurable plague'. You know that Tut is a Satyr and the father of the three sisters.


      Ludwig the Leprechaun told you that he believes the creation of the Blight Sisters had something to do with the 'faery gates' closing. This means that would have happened around this time as well. Ludwig hopes that by purifying them, the gates will re-open and he can go home.


      It is also at this time that the kingdom of Tor is established. Founded by Torquill Von Demillo who united the region under his rule.

      "Has it been truly so long since my last entry? Years slip past me as
      months once did. The bitten breeds of vampires local to this world now
      plague me as moths to a flame. The sun burns them, and their heads are as
      easy to remove as any other. Perhaps its true that weakness starts in the
      mind.


      Their blood, however, does not carry the taint of disease. Though I've routed most of the plague from my lands the flavor lingers still in the livestock. Yet I am nothing if not adaptable. The Lycans that plague my woods and hunt my streets were as quickly fooled as any other. Now they hunt for me. Soon I'll have a proper wine cellar fitting a man of my stature. I must endeavor to write more, and savor my time.
