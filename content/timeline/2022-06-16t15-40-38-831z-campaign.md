      The party has settled into their new lives but the threat of the shadowmen
      and the mysterious Lady of Thorns looms over them.


      Muspella captures an orc named Batface Jim that had been infected by Darkweed. They learn that Greater Restoration will remove the infection but the spell requires Diamond Dust and they used the last of Ancient Eunice's supply. They also learn the location of a shadowmen fort called Twisted Knife. The fort is run by an orcish shadowman named Braxus and he commands two captains named Talon the truth seeker and Rigor the Boar.


      A were-rat goblin discovers the party on their path to Twisted Knife and offers them information in exchange for the tears they need to purify the tree of Corruption. They deceive the creature and learn that the Shadowmen are seeking a collapsed cave said to contain the body of Myrcella Roudgara's trueborn son and the vampiric childer of Torquil Von Demillo.

          Muspella captures a darkweed-infected orc named Batface Jim. From him,
          they learn about a Shadowman fort not far from their grove called
          Twisted Knife. The fort is controlled by another orc-turned shadowman
          by the name of Braxxus, and the captains under his command are Talon
          the Truth Seeker, and Rigor the Boar.


          Remi discovers a method of curing the darkweed infection, a spell called Greater Restoration. However, the spell requires Diamond Dust. They use the last of Ancient Eunice's supply on Batface Jim in order to get him to talk.


          A were-rat goblin discovers the party on their path to Twisted Knife and offers them information in exchange for the tears they need to purify the tree of Corruption. They deceive the creature and learn that the Shadowmen are seeking a collapsed cave said to contain the body of Myrcella Roudgara's trueborn son and the vampiric childer of Torquil Von Demillo; Demetri.

          **A party divided**


          After the defeat of Braxxus and the fall of Fort Twisted Knife the party was given the choice of searching for the natural born son of Myrcella Roudgara or going with Ludwig the spriggan to purify the Blight Sister: Corruption.


          Unwilling to not do both; the, now warchief, Muspella took her barbarian warriors east to find the body of Tharon Roudgara. Hadrianna and Remi assembled a new party to head east into goblin territory to deal with Corruption.


          **Grip's Sudden but inevitable betrayal**


          Nate was contacted by a Grip, a green grung in hiding after his request for aid was denied by the Elder. Grip claimed that his people were under attack not only by the goblins but also 'Red Trees' with a taste for grung flesh. He also claimed to have contact with a man who could tell them how to find the Lost & Found in order to regain Remi's memories.


          The party agreed to aid his people in exchange for the information, but in the end, he attempted to lead them into an ambush. His betrayal was uncovered early, and after Hadrianna removed one of his arms, he agreed to help them ambush the ambush. Defeating the goblin were-rat Grung had attempted to betray them too, as well as the Red Trees. 


          So Grip made good on the information he promised and told them of a Necromancer living in an invisible tower on the way to the goblin city of Brown Water.

      **The End of the Grim War**


      Wearing the enchanted flayed faces they discovered in Castle Tor to mask their appearance the party is able to enter the Uruk city of Tektima. Once inside they ingratiated themselves with the locals, uncovered the artifact Grim Gash used to claim the Uruk's loyalty and turn the Uruk against the Orcs. In so doing they also rescued 11 captives from their home and learned that Wolf Grove had already fallen to Grim Gash.


      With the help of Kwizbet the party returns to Roudgara forest where they are reunited with old friends and join the fight against the Orcs.


      While retaking Wolf Grove from the Grim Horde, Grim Gash and Lebanon Glambrina arranged a secret meeting in the Spirit Garden. The party, heavily weakened by prolonged battle, made it just in time to witness Lebanon handing the baby Elpis over to Grim Gash. A band of Shadowmen behind her and Gerald Stumpton at her side. Lebanon, Gerald, and the shadowmen departed shortly after, having already planted the black violescent or 'Dark Weed'. Grim Gash left a small group of orcs and one unpaid troll behind to fend off his pursuers to make his own escape. The party dealt with them while the Spirit Mother attacked the dark weed with lightning and rain to try and prevent its spread. Giving her druids time to arrive. Meanwhile, the Barbarians patrolling the outskirts of the forest on Muspella's orders encountered and subdued Grim Gash with the aid of a Spider Bear.


      The war, now known as the Grim War, comes to an end.

    overview: Based on Torquill's Journal the event known as the Sundering may have
      taken place around this time. You have heard of this event from several
      ancient creatures. It has been claimed that during this event the Gods
      were banished and the world was tossed into chaos. Torquill's account
      suggests that he may have been involved in that event. He also names
      others, Chasm, and Soul Huntre.

      "In victory, we learn the short-sighted nature of the struggle. Let us be
      clear that no authority exists without serving a function. It is very
      important to understand what that is **BEFORE** you overthrow them!


      It would seem that without the bindings of flesh, or the tiring ache of entropy, the mouths of ghosts never grow weary. Chasm holds to Soul Huntre's plan and delights in the slaughter but how he can stand the mountain of dead that surely must bark at his heels, I have no idea. I only hope they find a solution soon, even the blood of this world tastes sad."

      "Something has gone terribly wrong and of course, Soul Huntre is nowhere
      to be found! Some great darkness is spreading across the sky, it is so
      much harder to eat when the cattle are spooked!


      Chasm be damned the dark elf still revels in this curse, so long as he has blood to spill. At least the void appears to take the ghosts with it. With each new world, I gain a temporary reprieve."

      "Gods be damned I dream of a world without fucking liches. Do I remain to
      die here or endure the indignity of being saved by a lich.... or do I
      chance the astral bridge? It's no wonder the Liches forsake their skin,
      this world confines me enough without all this flesh binding me even
      tighter."

      "Itâ€™s been a mere 130 years since we celebrated Soul Huntre's victory and
      how hollow a victory it has been. Still, The devourer has finally been
      satisfied. Better yet Skatvold had to sacrifice himself to fix our
      mistakes! I can't help but feel that the lack of a sunset was done to
      spite me, but I'll take the win. Time to find a way out of this world.


      I need to establish a kingdom if I'm to remain fed, these creatures can't seem to do much else but die and their blood is soured with fear and disease. A kingdom to pen the herd and breed sweeter stock is the only way."


      *\- from the journal of Torquill Von Demillo*


      Ludwig the Leprechaun claimed it was during this time, or perhaps before, that the Blight Sisters were created by his friend Tut. He did so due to an 'incurable plague'. You know that Tut is a Satyr and the father of the three sisters.


      Ludwig the Leprechaun told you that he believes the creation of the Blight Sisters had something to do with the 'faery gates' closing. This means that would have happened around this time as well. Ludwig hopes that by purifying them, the gates will re-open and he can go home.


      It is also at this time that the kingdom of Tor is established. Founded by Torquill Von Demillo who united the region under his rule.

      "Has it been truly so long since my last entry? Years slip past me as
      months once did. The bitten breeds of vampires local to this world now
      plague me as moths to a flame. The sun burns them, and their heads are as
      easy to remove as any other. Perhaps its true that weakness starts in the
      mind.


      Their blood, however, does not carry the taint of disease. Though I've routed most of the plague from my lands the flavor lingers still in the livestock. Yet I am nothing if not adaptable. The Lycans that plague my woods and hunt my streets were as quickly fooled as any other. Now they hunt for me. Soon I'll have a proper wine cellar fitting a man of my stature. I must endeavor to write more, and savor my time.

          **Gates of Castle Tor**

          The party battled their way across the undead covered bridge to the magically sealed gates of Tor. Along the way Muspella was beaten down and crushed to death only to be returned by death himself, Earnest Clay. In opening the gate it was revealed that Thaishin, not Muspella, had demon blood coursing in his veins. Shortly after that revelation Thaishin was called away by the Spirit Mother to complete some mysterious task.



          **Lost & Found**

          \[Coming Soon]



          **Unearthed Secrets**

          Tor was a land lost to shadow and where the horrors of the past still reverberate as echo's of the long dead. It was here the party learned of Torquill's true fear, Dragon Blood. They obtained dragon blood by uncovering an ancient slumbering dragon named Fetek, the source of Hadriana's own arcane heritage. By consuming his blood she unlocked more of her power and powers yet to come.

          **Isaterra falls to Corruption**


          One of the Blight Sisters revealed herself by claiming the body of Isaterra and attacking the party. The conflict only ended when a creature named Farlan shoved Isaterra into a shadow portal, vowing to save her and urging her friends to defeat the Blight Sisters back in the forest.


          **Remi joins the group**


          While camping a Tabaxi named Remnants of History found the group. As an old friend of Bulgar, she decided to travel with them to Orcus where she worked as a blacksmith.


          **Immaculate Conception**


          Hadriana reveals that she has been dreaming of angels, or at least one specifically named Justice. She then leads the group to a small orkin farmhouse. The family welcomes them in to stay and break bread but as the food hits the table their very pregnant daughter goes into labor. Remi and Hadriana assist the birth and mere moments after the new mother greats her smiling boy it fades from view. Remi collects the placenta.


          **Gnoll Slavers and a Familiar Face**


          Before the party can meet with King Goruk Ukatie of the Bronze Horde they are instructed to deal with a gnoll problem in a nearby village. There they defeat the gnolls, but also scare off a villain named 'The dullahan'. When the dust settles they realize one of the slaves being sold by the gnolls was Gurahl. He confesses that the shadowmen kidnapping of Isaterra and Hadriana was a shadowmen plot to get a darkweed planted in the soul garden and that it was Lebanon Glambrina, the seer of Umbrage Grove, that arrived after their escape with another man Gurahl did not know. This man was able to return Gurahls legs by grafting them back on. Lebanon then brought him back to Umbrage Grove. Gurahl may have had more to say but he fled during the Dullahan attack.


          **Meeting with King Goruk Ukatie**


          Goruk reveals that Grim Gash stole artifacts from the treasury and that the alliance between the Grim Horde and the Uruk may be magical in nature. It is also revealed that the leadership of the Bronze Horde are also dragon-blooded sorcerers much like Hadriana. Goruk even reveals his own bronze dragon wings to her. The baby, Elpis, is believed by the Grim Horde to be a child of prophecy and their attacks on the forest are to reclaim the child.

          **Travel to Knossos**


          Here the party reunites with Killian and completes the minotaur's labyrinth to speak with the king. Noting Muspella's relationship with Gerald Stumpton (who is revealed to have originally been from Knossos) and his friend Tiat Honorskull (who is revealed to have once been the king of Knossos) the party is given the services of Bulgar a minotaur diplomat who will ensure they get a meeting with the king of the orcs.
