      The party has settled into their new lives but the threat of the shadowmen
      and the mysterious Lady of Thorns looms over them.


      Muspella captures an orc named Batface Jim that had been infected by Darkweed. They learn that Greater Restoration will remove the infection but the spell requires Diamond Dust and they used the last of Ancient Eunice's supply. They also learn the location of a shadowmen fort called Twisted Knife. The fort is run by an orcish shadowman named Braxus and he commands two captains named Talon the truth seeker and Rigor the Boar.


      A were-rat goblin discovers the party on their path to Twisted Knife and offers them information in exchange for the tears they need to purify the tree of Corruption. They deceive the creature and learn that the Shadowmen are seeking a collapsed cave said to contain the body of Myrcella Roudgara's trueborn son and the vampiric childer of Torquil Von Demillo.

          Muspella captures a darkweed-infected orc named Batface Jim. From him,
          they learn about a Shadowman fort not far from their grove called
          Twisted Knife. The fort is controlled by another orc-turned shadowman
          by the name of Braxxus, and the captains under his command are Talon
          the Truth Seeker, and Rigor the Boar.


          Remi discovers a method of curing the darkweed infection, a spell called Greater Restoration. However, the spell requires Diamond Dust. They use the last of Ancient Eunice's supply on Batface Jim in order to get him to talk.


          A were-rat goblin discovers the party on their path to Twisted Knife and offers them information in exchange for the tears they need to purify the tree of Corruption. They deceive the creature and learn that the Shadowmen are seeking a collapsed cave said to contain the body of Myrcella Roudgara's trueborn son and the vampiric childer of Torquil Von Demillo; Demetri.

          **A party divided**


          After the defeat of Braxxus and the fall of Fort Twisted Knife the party was given the choice of searching for the natural born son of Myrcella Roudgara or going with Ludwig the spriggan to purify the Blight Sister: Corruption.


          Unwilling to not do both; the, now warchief, Muspella took her barbarian warriors east to find the body of Tharon Roudgara. Hadrianna and Remi assembled a new party to head east into goblin territory to deal with Corruption.


          **Grip's Sudden but inevitable betrayal**


          Nate was contacted by a Grip, a green grung in hiding after his request for aid was denied by the Elder. Grip claimed that his people were under attack not only by the goblins but also 'Red Trees' with a taste for grung flesh. He also claimed to have contact with a man who could tell them how to find the Lost & Found in order to regain Remi's memories.


          The party agreed to aid his people in exchange for the information, but in the end, he attempted to lead them into an ambush. His betrayal was uncovered early, and after Hadrianna removed one of his arms, he agreed to help them ambush the ambush. Defeating the goblin were-rat Grung had attempted to betray them too, as well as the Red Trees. 


          So Grip made good on the information he promised and told them of a Necromancer living in an invisible tower on the way to the goblin city of Brown Water.

      **The End of the Grim War**


      Wearing the enchanted flayed faces they discovered in Castle Tor to mask their appearance the party is able to enter the Uruk city of Tektima. Once inside they ingratiated themselves with the locals, uncovered the artifact Grim Gash used to claim the Uruk's loyalty and turn the Uruk against the Orcs. In so doing they also rescued 11 captives from their home and learned that Wolf Grove had already fallen to Grim Gash.


      With the help of Kwizbet the party returns to Roudgara forest where they are reunited with old friends and join the fight against the Orcs.


      While retaking Wolf Grove from the Grim Horde, Grim Gash and Lebanon Glambrina arranged a secret meeting in the Spirit Garden. The party, heavily weakened by prolonged battle, made it just in time to witness Lebanon handing the baby Elpis over to Grim Gash. A band of Shadowmen behind her and Gerald Stumpton at her side. Lebanon, Gerald, and the shadowmen departed shortly after, having already planted the black violescent or 'Dark Weed'. Grim Gash left a small group of orcs and one unpaid troll behind to fend off his pursuers to make his own escape. The party dealt with them while the Spirit Mother attacked the dark weed with lightning and rain to try and prevent its spread. Giving her druids time to arrive. Meanwhile, the Barbarians patrolling the outskirts of the forest on Muspella's orders encountered and subdued Grim Gash with the aid of a Spider Bear.


      The war, now known as the Grim War, comes to an end.

          **Gates of Castle Tor**

          The party battled their way across the undead covered bridge to the magically sealed gates of Tor. Along the way Muspella was beaten down and crushed to death only to be returned by death himself, Earnest Clay. In opening the gate it was revealed that Thaishin, not Muspella, had demon blood coursing in his veins. Shortly after that revelation Thaishin was called away by the Spirit Mother to complete some mysterious task.



          **Lost & Found**

          \[Coming Soon]



          **Unearthed Secrets**

          Tor was a land lost to shadow and where the horrors of the past still reverberate as echo's of the long dead. It was here the party learned of Torquill's true fear, Dragon Blood. They obtained dragon blood by uncovering an ancient slumbering dragon named Fetek, the source of Hadriana's own arcane heritage. By consuming his blood she unlocked more of her power and powers yet to come.

          **Isaterra falls to Corruption**


          One of the Blight Sisters revealed herself by claiming the body of Isaterra and attacking the party. The conflict only ended when a creature named Farlan shoved Isaterra into a shadow portal, vowing to save her and urging her friends to defeat the Blight Sisters back in the forest.


          **Remi joins the group**


          While camping a Tabaxi named Remnants of History found the group. As an old friend of Bulgar, she decided to travel with them to Orcus where she worked as a blacksmith.


          **Immaculate Conception**


          Hadriana reveals that she has been dreaming of angels, or at least one specifically named Justice. She then leads the group to a small orkin farmhouse. The family welcomes them in to stay and break bread but as the food hits the table their very pregnant daughter goes into labor. Remi and Hadriana assist the birth and mere moments after the new mother greats her smiling boy it fades from view. Remi collects the placenta.


          **Gnoll Slavers and a Familiar Face**


          Before the party can meet with King Goruk Ukatie of the Bronze Horde they are instructed to deal with a gnoll problem in a nearby village. There they defeat the gnolls, but also scare off a villain named 'The dullahan'. When the dust settles they realize one of the slaves being sold by the gnolls was Gurahl. He confesses that the shadowmen kidnapping of Isaterra and Hadriana was a shadowmen plot to get a darkweed planted in the soul garden and that it was Lebanon Glambrina, the seer of Umbrage Grove, that arrived after their escape with another man Gurahl did not know. This man was able to return Gurahls legs by grafting them back on. Lebanon then brought him back to Umbrage Grove. Gurahl may have had more to say but he fled during the Dullahan attack.


          **Meeting with King Goruk Ukatie**


          Goruk reveals that Grim Gash stole artifacts from the treasury and that the alliance between the Grim Horde and the Uruk may be magical in nature. It is also revealed that the leadership of the Bronze Horde are also dragon-blooded sorcerers much like Hadriana. Goruk even reveals his own bronze dragon wings to her. The baby, Elpis, is believed by the Grim Horde to be a child of prophecy and their attacks on the forest are to reclaim the child.

          **Travel to Knossos**


          Here the party reunites with Killian and completes the minotaur's labyrinth to speak with the king. Noting Muspella's relationship with Gerald Stumpton (who is revealed to have originally been from Knossos) and his friend Tiat Honorskull (who is revealed to have once been the king of Knossos) the party is given the services of Bulgar a minotaur diplomat who will ensure they get a meeting with the king of the orcs.

          **Travel to Glandor**


          Muspella reveals that before they left Gerald Stumpton had given her a ring found with her as a baby, and since putting the ring on she has been hearing a voice claiming to be her father. The voice claimed the lich of Glandor owed him a favor and he intended to cash it in to be resurrected into a fresh body. Along the way, the party encountered halfling farmers who oversaw fields tended to by the walking dead. They learned that it was these halflings the Gnolls sold The Evil tainted waters of the forest to, and that by using the water to animate the dead they were able to revitalize the soil despite the raging storm of wild magic.


          Upon meeting with Victor Dark the party is sent on a quest to rid the west wing of an old ghost while the lich prepared the ritual. However, in this land the party could not feel the connection to their Spirit Mother nor could they summon her for a renown fire. Their dreams were tormented as well and when the time came to resurrect Muspella's father she instead smashed the ring and all watched in horror as the soul, now free of its protections, was claimed by a ghostly hand.

          **Travel to the Centaur Nation**


          Once the party has proven themselves they are allowed to travel across the Forgotten Valley using special bunkers set up by the Keepers. The wild magic storm is extremely dangerous and they must keep up their pace to not be caught in the storm overnight. During their early travels, they encounter a badly injured centaur who was on a hunt to form his own herd. The party heals the centaur and assists him in defeating a giant lightning boar, then returns him to his village. Thaishin impresses the centaur shaman with the gifts of the Spirit Mother by enriching the soil around the village. Muspella bests a centaur warrior in an honor duel but in her rage nearly kills him. Luckily Isaterra was there for an easy healing and the party rests enjoying the company of the centaurs. Before they venture on to their next stop Muspella reveals that she has need to go to Glandor, a place of death ruled by a Lich named Victor Dark. Killian refuses to accompany a fool's errand. Instead, he takes away stone with him to their next stop, the minotaur city of Knossos, so that they lose as little time as possible in their quest.

          **Travel to Keeper's March**


          The party spends some time at Keeper's March where they are given better weapons and tasked with proving themselves capable of surviving No Man's Land and The Storm of wild magic that rages within the Forgotten Valley. During this time Hadriana gets a job as a chef at the local tavern and grows closer to Killian despite his sister's objections, Muspella meets a minotaur named Tiat Honorskull whom she had only known from campfire stories told to her growing up by Gerald Stumpton and attacks a member of the local clergy for refusing to heal an injured grafter, Hadriana convinces a grafter to help disguise her draconic wings to appear grafted on rather than a natural part of her, Kwizbet lays low as a cat to remain hidden from the Spires outpost within Keeper's March while keeping busy in the study of arcane tattoos with a grafter named Thor. Finally, the party is introduced to Corwyn, leader of Keeper's March, and informed that there was recently a schism within the Bronze Horde to the east but that they would need to speak with them to learn more. In order to do that, they would need the help of a minotaur from Knossos as the orcs still harbor old hatreds from the Dragon Wars and would not let them near without a diplomat.

          **Start of the Grim War**


          With the return of Chloe, Killian must return to his people but upon learning of the orc's alliance with the Uruk, a human tribe from the Forgotten Valley, he becomes more concerned. The orcs hate the Uruk and vice versa as the Uruk were once servants of the orc who broke free following the Dragon Wars. After some debate, the party is given the choice of remaining to deal with the grung alliance or departing with Killian to investigate the orc threat. They chose to go with Killian.


          Melyn Pren arrives to meet the party, and lays eyes on his granddaughter Hadriana, for the first time. He requests that they take Kwizbet with them before leading the group on a vision quest. The very personal vision quest unites and bonds the party as they work together to conquer each other's doubts and fears. During this quest, the group encounters a vision of The God King Torquil, dragon slayer, of Ravished. He taunts the party, severing Hadriana's left wing from her back and killing Thaishin. A warning of quests to come and the power that will be required to best the mother's immortal foe.

          **An Outsider Arrives**


          **Killian**

          Killian, a member of Keepers of the Dark, was captured by Gerald Stumpton and brought back to the grove. While tradition dictates he be killed, the party negotiated with their elders to learn more about him. It was revealed that he only came to the forest in search of his sister Chlo. She had been taken captive by gnolls to be sold to the grung. The party arranged to purchase Chlo back from the grung by trading a very potent poison called Midnight Tears.



          **The Evil**

          During the rescue of Chlo, the party finds the band of gnolls that had captured her in the first place. They are shipping barrels of water out to the Forgotten Valley. Muspella, in her rage, causes one of the barrels to burst; spilling the water upon the ground. Thaishin and Isaterra instantly recognize the cursed water as being tainted with The Evil. It takes the grove Elders to contain the spillage and prevent the corruption from spreading. Amid the gnoll belongings, they also find notes that reveal the gnolls were buying the water from the grung to sell in a place called Glandor out in the Forgotten Valley.

          **The Hermit**


          Hadriana was informed by her father that a hermit living in the forest would be able to help her learn the secrets of her sorcerous magic. The party found the hermit on their way to Umbrage Grove. The transmutation wizard, in hiding from 'The Spires', introduced himself as Kwizbet. The old man agreed to mentor Hadriana out of respect for her late mother. He had been sent by 'The Spires', a community of wizards, to investigate rumors of witchcraft in the woods. Upon meeting Hadriana's mother, the wizard chose a life in exile over turning her in.


          **Umbrage Grove**


          The group traveled to the neighboring grove of Umbrage, who also worship the Spirit Mother, and met a band of their residents. They met Lebanon Glambrina the Magnificent, the seer, Edward Scornborn, the elder, and a few lower-ranking citizens as well. Among these was Gurahl, who had two legs that seemed to have never been removed. No explanation for his presence was uncovered.


          **Hadriana finds Moira**


          Hadriana was informed by Edward Scornborn that there is another way to bond with beasts beyond The Great Hunt. Using that information, she struck a deal with a raven named Moira. Moira agreed to watch over and serve her in exchange for shiny things. Upon Hadriana's death, her ring of disguise will belong to Moira.

          **Goblins and Grung**


          Goblins were caught stealing fish from the grove, and Hadriana's father requested that the group deal with them. In doing so, they discovered that the goblins were hungry runaway slaves to the grung. The party nearly caused a political incident before learning that the grung was an ally of the grove, and followers of the Spirit Mother. The group expressed their disdain forallying with slavers to the elders of Wolf Grove, to little effect.


          **The Blight Sisters**


          Returning from the tree cities of the grung, Hadriana found a gold coin. Soon after, she began turning to gold, starting with the hand that took the coin. In search of the coin's origins, the group found themselves in front of an old ruin where they met Ludwig the Leprechaun. He informed them of the Blight Sisters - three cursed dryads of the forest named Corruption, Betrayal, and Misery. Ludwig believed that finding each Blight Sister's tree and purifying it would re-open the forest gates into the Feywild, allowing him to finally go home.

          #### The Campaign Begins


          **The Great Hunt**


          When a member of Wolf Grove graduates from their basic training they are sent on a hunt. They must use what they have learned to claim the life of a great beast, which they then serve at the evening feast. In this way, they not only prove themselves to the Spirit Mother, but also to the beasts. Some believe that the beast chooses you as much as you choose them. Once the ritual has been completed and the feasting done, a bond is formed between the hunter and their chosen prey. Muspella brought back a wolf, Thaishin a panther, and Isaterra a spider. Hadriana, being of noble descent, received no training and did not participate in the hunt.


          **Orcs**


          During the hunt, Muspella and Thaishin discovered the first signs of orcs in the forest. Unaware of what they were, they returned home straight away to inform Gerald Stumpton, Muspella's adopted father and grove scout.


          **The Spirit Gardens**


          With the hunt complete, the party was assembled and sent to a secret location within the forest called The Spirit Gardens. As druids, Isaterra and Thaishin were directed to plant their soul seeds, binding themselves to the forest. It was here that Hadriana met the soul tree of her mother, and thus learned the truth of her heritage.


          **More Orcs**


          In the weeks that followed, Gerald Stumpton organized the scouts and warriors of Wolf Grove against the orcs, rousting them from their hiding places. Muspella, Hadriana, Thaishin, and Isaterra were selected by Elder Priscilla Oakborn to serve and train together as a single unit. While scouting, they uncovered a 3 legged dire wolf who had just escaped a bear trap left by orcs. They healed the wolf, then tracked the invading horde back to camp where they utilized the orcs' own crates of alchemist fire against them. Finding that one of the enemies had been pregnant, Isaterra used her impressive knowledge of medicine to save the baby from its dead mother's womb. With more orcs after them, they immediately rendezvoused with Gerald Stumpton to fend off their pursuers and were able to bring the dire wolf and baby safely back to Wolf Grove.


          **Kidnapped by Shadowmen**


          Once free of the orcs, the group began the journey back to Wolf Grove. During the night, after setting up camp and heading to sleep, Isaterra and Hadriana were taken. Upon awakening, they found themselves in The Black - a place they had been raised to steer clear of. They had been captured by shadowmen. They escaped with the help of Gurahl, a member of Umbrage Grove to the south. His legs had been cut off by the shadowmen, so they had no choice but to leave him behind.


          **Naming of Elpis and Vidar**


          Rejoined once again with Thaishin and Muspella, the group finally made it back home. Once there, they named the baby orc Elpis and the dire wolf Vidar

      Ludwig the Leprechaun claimed it was during this time, or perhaps before, that the Blight Sisters were created by his friend Tut. He did so due to an 'incurable plague'. You know that Tut is a Satyr and the father of the three sisters.


      Ludwig the Leprechaun told you that he believes the creation of the Blight Sisters had something to do with the 'faery gates' closing. This means that would have happened around this time as well. Ludwig hopes that by purifying them, the gates will re-open and he can go home.
