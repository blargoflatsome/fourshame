      Muspella captures a darkweed infected orc named Batface Jim. From him they
      learn about a shadowman fort not far from their grove called Twisted
      Knife. The fort is controlled by another orc turned shadowman by the name
      of Braxxus, and the captains under his command Talon the Truth Seeker, and
      Rigor the Boar.


      Remi discovers a method of curing the darkweed infection, a spell called Greater Restoration. Howevever, the spell requires Diamond Dust. They use the last of Ancient Eunice's supply on Batface Jim in order to get him to talk.


      A were-rat goblin discovers the party on their path to Twisted Knife and offers them information in exchange for the tears they need to purify the tree of Corruption. They deceive the creature and learn that the Shadowmen are seeking a collapsed cave said to contain the body of Myrcella Roudgara's true born son and the vampiric childer of Torquil Von Demillo; Demetri.
