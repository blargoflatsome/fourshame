# Tracking Time.

## The Sun

The sun does not rise, set, nor move across the sky. It merely winks on and winks off, becoming the moon. In the more civilized areas of the world, the time of day is tracked by 'counting the ticks'. This is made easier by clockwork contraptions brought into popularity by the gnomes of Thames. The physics of this setting is such that the world of Urroth does not have seasons. The weather is fairly consistent as you travel from place to place.

## Years

The year and months are tracked by 'The Old Ones'. Five massive statues that predate known history have been given names, and each maintains a year.

* **The Thinker:** Some think of this as the creator or father of the other statues due to its central position on Urroth. It has four faces, each facing one of the other four statues. The thinker has no discernable gender and holds out an orb in it's right hand. The left hand is close to its body and may have once held a book.
* **The Shepherd:** He stands in the Northern part of the Urroth, in the Ellerdahl Forests. He looks south, toward the Thinker. He holds a crook staff at an angle toward the ground as if to lean on it, holding the top with both hands folded together. His face is that of a satisfied older man.
* **The Gatherer:** The Gatherer sits several miles into the Sea off the coast of Orcus. She holds an empty basket in her right hand, resting on her shoulder. Her left hand appears to hold seaweed or some other plant. Cracks in the basket constantly leak out water that rains down all around her. Her face is pleasant, with a smile, facing east, toward the thinker.
* **The Hunter:** This statue is a female hunter and sits in the south, in the Dead Sea desert. Her right hand appears to have held a spear or sword at one time though it is gone now. Her face is fierce and glares south toward the mountains instead of north toward the thinker.
* **The Warrior:** Standing in the west, on the coast near the Thames city of Orsgard. He is a powerfully built man with a massive sword in his right hand and a shield in his left. His sword is cast up into the air, almost saluting the thinker in the west.

Upon the hand of each statue there rests a great beacon of wood and other combustible materials. These beacons are specially prepared by an order of monks who tend to the statues and the tracking of time. Each month of the year is named for the color that the beacon of that year's statue burns. So you might say 'it was the first day of the crimson thinker' to denote the first day of the new year.
