While the gates to the fey-Wild are closed we have unearthed many ancient texts on the subject as well as conducted a few rare but precious interviews with the fey who reside on our side of the gates.

It is unknown if the fey-Wild is what gave us mortals of the Material Realm the ability to wonder and imagine or if that ability is what created the fey-Wild, but there is no doubt that the two are inexorably linked.

The fey-Wild is separated from our world by a Curtain but the landscape is much the same; only reshaped through the lens of Wonder.

What is Wonder? Let me put it this way. A forest on the border of a small village is perfectly safe, aside from the natural dangers such as wolves or poisoned flowers. Yet, the more the locals speak of the unnatural threats, that say 'hunt lost children, the more those stories prove to become true. The act of storytelling, as well as the act of believing the stories being told, produces Wonder. It's the runoff exhaled by imagination.

Some hypothesize that Wonder and Arcanum, the energy of creation that mages manipulate, are the same thing. The belief states that as we explore and try to understand the world with eyes of wonder we actually generate the very powers we manipulate to take control of the unknowable. However, the theory cautions that as we learn to understand the world and the very magic that we rely on, we produce less Wonder and therefore risk losing magic entirely not to mention the fey who need our Wonder like we need air.

I'm not sure I prescribe to that theory, but with this understanding of Wonder and its importance to the fey, we begin to understand why children are so important to them.

## History

The fey have given no indication that they were ever overly concerned about the Sundering or the fate of the divine gods. Many would have expected the fey to simply fill the power vacuum left behind. However, when the Void blackened out the sky and those early mortals gaped in horror at their impending destruction the fey we confronted with their own nightmare.

A creature of blackest pitch known only as Despair appeared before the Seelie courts with an army of ugly wretch at her command. The Seelie were as caught off guard as the mortals and one by one their cities fell. At first, they blamed the Unseelie, believing Despair to be a member of their treacherous courts, but Despair held no such allegiance Soon the Unseelie began to fall as well.

By the time of the Dark Ages, when the mortals had all but lost hope and their ability to wonder of anything but their survival, Despair had pushed the fey courts to the brink of total annihilation.

It was during this time that the Fairy Gates closed; trapping many fey within the material realm. Seelie and Unseelie alike found themselves in this new reality. One where they had to work together to spark the imaginations of the material realm they now lived within if they ever hoped to return home, or indeed, to stay alive.

Though many debate the origins of the Dragons, some believe they are fey. Others believe they are simply magical beasts of a different sort. Bound to and enhanced by Arcanum but not born of mortal imagination, like the fey. However, when the dragon wars began the largest collective of surviving fey lived within the Elderahl forest. Protected, as they had always been, by the Irishne.

So when Mutar, the green dragon, first arrived in that very forest many among the Spires speculated the fey and the elves would welcome the beast. For no mortal on Urroth could witness the great dragons soaring in the skies above and not be filled with wonder.

Perhaps they did, we do not know what transpired during that early encounter. What we do know is that the dragons did not cast their shadows across the lands of Urroth to instill wonder; but rather terror. Mutar used the fey, the Irishne elves, and all manner of other creatures to create a race of, what can only be described as, infernals.

Mere foot soldiers and raiders at first, striking out at the neighboring villages to steal food. Then people. Then buildings. The elves called out for help all across Urroth but their cries fell on deaf ears.

When the ancients, Orom and Uralom, fell from the sky we dispatched an envoy of mages to the forest to entreat the fey and learn of their hardships and allegiances. Their early reports informed us of the tragic genocide of the irishne people as well as the displacement of many others, such as the native forest gnome. Though we believe the forest gnomes died out soon after or interbred with other more common races of gnomes during the Ghalen Migration.

## The Fairy Queen Of Elderahl

It was while performing the archaeological study of Elderahl Forest that our envoys first encountered the fey who remained. These fey no longer organized in courts of Seelie or Unseelie but were instead ruled by a solitary queen. They claimed that so long as the sun was visible she was charming and full of grace as were all within her domain

However, somehow she was so precisely attuned with the sun that at the moment of its departure, she would "spin" upon her hips. Head down to a new more horrifying head up. This new persona was violent, spiteful, and cunning. Furthermore, it was reported that following her shift, her subjects changed as well. From whimsy to pure malice in an instant. It was shortly after these initial reports that we lost contact with our envoy entirely.

## The City Of Ember

On the other side of the continent, near Thames, we have come to understand that those were the first of the fey courts to fall to Despair and that there have been no fey sightings in that area since before the dragon wars. Still, some among the gnomes of Thames, famous for their inventive creativity, have departed in recent years to re-settle their ancestral home of Ember. We understand they hope to find the fey that their people once served.

> "Some among the Unveiled Historical Society believe it's the industrialization of Thames and the automated scrutiny applied to the gnomish inventions that keep the fey away from that area. Claiming the factories are no more than industrial death machines to wonder."Alison, fey Historian of the Unveiled Historical Society

## Present Day

Without access to the fey-wild to flee to the fey of the Material Realm have to fear the reprisal of those they torment and toy with like never before. This has led to the fey becoming more secretive, and cunning, and many never stray far from the shadows.

The only known fey settlement is Elderahl forest and few would dare hunt those woods but you may encounter the fey just about anywhere large numbers of humanoids exist. The fey must go where the Wonder is.

> "There is one way for a desperate fey to get Wonder that doesn't require the risk of city living. A fey can suck the Wonder-like marrow from the bones of other fey. It is a dark practice long outlawed among both courts, but the courts have no power here."Alison, fey Historian of the Unveiled Historical Society

## Summoning The Fey

fey cannot be summoned from across the Curtain due to the gates being closed. fey summoned are either fey from the material realm ripped from their homes and the safety of their groups or you may replace them with a "spiritual" alternative.

The Astral Realm is a conceptual realm of thought where the spirits of plants, animals, celestial bodies, concepts, sins, and basically anything and everything mortals have named exists. So they don't summon an actual fey, they summon the 'idea of a fey' or the astral spirit of a fey. This can also work for summoning Demons, Celestials, or any other creature type that doesn't exist in Urroth.

## Running The Fey

Fey of the fey-wild are arcane creatures born of mortal imagination. A single mortal is incapable of creating a fey but when an idea of pure Wonder spreads among hundreds of mortals a fey to match that idea may be born. All fey created in this manner appear within the Fey-Wild. This means that no new fey have been able to cross over into the Material since the time of the gates closing. From its birth to its death a wonder born fey is its own creature capable of independent thought and free will. The blueprints of what that fey is (how it looks, some basic behavior patterns, and what drives it) are set by the beliefs of the mortals who imagined it. Because of this fey of similar types may behave and even appear drastically different based on what region they hail from.

All fey have the unique ability to breed with any other creature as well as each other. The fey of the material realm are the results of these unions and not the imaginations of humanoids. However, the potential immortality of the fey and their dependence upon the wonder of native material inhabitants means they very rarely breed and never without purpose. So long as a fey has access to Wonder it will never die of old age. However, some fear that as the fey of the material realm breed their descendants become more attuned to the Material Realm. Requiring less Wonder to survive, but also experiencing the entropy of death.

Regardless, all fey need to feed on the wonder of mortals. The mischief of their old ways is just much harder to get away with now that they can't simply rush across the veil to the Fey-Wild. Some, like the Darklings, have learned to survive within the crushing despair of the Fade. Others, such as the Banshee, find solace in the emotionless landscape of the ethereal. Most, however, find neither to their liking and have adapted to existence purely in the material. Running nursing homes for the weakened elderly, daycares full of imaginative children, taverns draining their guests while being regaled in story and drink. Or, of course, the classic wondering caravans of mad actors putting on plays, puppet theaters, freak shows, and other circus tent attractions.

### Material Realm Fey

The old courts hold no sway over the fey of the Material Realm but old habits die hard. The fey are often still split between the ideology of the Seelie and the Unseelie.

#### Seelie

The Seelie supports the ideals of beauty and Wonder through inspired imagination. They adore the inhabitants of the material realm in the same way humans adore animals. While they must feed they often try to ensure their dinner has a good time or at least doesn't remember.

#### Unseelie

The Unseelie espouses a different ideal. Wonder through terror. They farm the people of the material realm the way a human would farm cattle. Whatever it takes to get the most out of a crop the fastest. The Unseelie still believe in beauty, however, and while they strive to trigger the imaginations of mortals through suspense and horror they most often do so with some sense of elegance. Fear has a way of lingering, even growing over time all on its own. The Unseelie need only give it a push. The downside is, of course, that this also attracts the attention of Wretch who are as happy to eat the fey as they are the crops.

### The Wretch

The Wretch are also native to the fey-Wild and much older than the fey. Some believe the wretch are proof that in the earliest development of the various humanoid species fear came before wonder. The wretch are disgusting swamp hags and monstrous bogeymen. Goblinoids originated in the fey-wild as wretch but as the fey came to power the goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears fled into the material realm. Modern goblinoids have no reliance on Wonder and live very short lives. Giving more credence to the fears of the fey and the ramifications of prolonged exposure to the material realm.

The wretch are, in short, parasites. Consuming the Wonder found in the material realm, or the bones of the fey, and giving nothing back. They do not generate arcane energy as the fey do. They do, however, still need it. It sustains and powers them just as it does the fey.

Like the fey, the wretch were not all across the veil when the gates closed. The cannibal hags of Tayan are among the most famous of the material realm wretch and many children still scream in the night after being visited by a bogeyman.

In Urroth the following creatures change their type to Wretch. This list is not exhaustive and you may find many others that fit the feel of a wretch.

* All Hags
* All Goblinoids add Wretch to their creature type
* The Oni aka Bogeymen
* Boggle
* Meenlock
* Sea Fury
* Hexblood

## Points Of Interest Within The Fey-Wild

Though the gates are closed they may not always be. Here are some details on what the other side of the curtain is like should your party find its way across.

Sadly, following the war with Despair, the Wilds of the fey are all but gone. Given way to the Wastes.

### The Wastes

The wastes were once solitary places. Small patches of land where Wonder was weak. Places inhospitable to the fey and home only to the wretch (and the only home the fey courts would allow them.)

Now, much of the fey-wild has been destroyed and brought to ruin by Despair and her war against the courts. The wretch have expanded the borders of the wastes by over-consuming the Wonder of the wilds. Corpses of fey litter the wastes. Withered and drained of Wonder by the wretch.

### The Charred Mountains

It is said that the breath of Uralom set an eternal blaze upon the Charred mountains. While the fires have died out in the material realm the mountain range still burns in the fey-wild. The mountain itself is not made of stone but rather a pile of long-dead Giants.

### The Storm

In the material realm, it's known as the Forgotten Valley but within the fey-Wild it's known only as The Storm. Composed of dragon bones and the broken bodies of the many dead who littered the valley at the end of the Final Battle; The Storm is where raw emotion meets endless wonder. Some believe it's a tear in the curtain and that travel between realms may be possible there but surviving the storm itself makes that theory impossible to test.
