This setting requires some alterations and limitations to RAW D&D. They are as follows.

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/altered-content#no-gods)No Gods

In this world, the Gods (with a capital G) are gone. This causes several changes to RAW D&D

* No Clerics (Though I am working on Mad Clerics as an alternative)
* No health potions. They have been replaced with herbalist healing salves. Generally speaking, they are weaker and mostly used during rest periods.
* Dangerous Resurrection. The magic still exists to perform a resurrection but learning it and casting it comes with a price and gains potentially unwanted attention.
* No Sorcerer of the Divine Soul

Some classes that relate to religion can still work but need to be re-flavored.

* Paladins in 5e are unchanged apart from none of them following a deity. It is purely the adherence to and belief in their oath that gives them power.
* Barbarian of the Zealot is largely fine. The DM just needs to remember there is no actual God at the other end of the barbarian's passion to reward or punish their devotion.
* Warlock of the Old Ones in this setting could be to a primordial force known as the Profane, or to the Void itself.

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/altered-content#altered-spells)Altered Spells

* Any spell that would allow you to travel or contact across the planes may only take you to the Ethereal, Fade, Astral, or Material planes. Attempting to go anywhere else results in 3d10 force damage.
* All Summoning spells summon Astral Spirits. These spirits are merely the manifestation of the 'idea' of the thing being summoned.
* Revify. The target gains the "resurrected" homebrew feat. Gaining the ability to see into the Ethereal but Suffering a -1 to Constitution

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/altered-content#lost-spells)Lost Spells

Some spells have either been lost to history or simply do not work without the Gods/Outer Planes to power them.

* Commune
* Divination
* Dream of the Blue Veil
* Infernal Calling
* Planar Ally
* Reincarnate
* Resurrection
* Temple of the Gods
* True Resurrection

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/altered-content#no-celestials-or-fiends)No Celestials Or Fiends

The Upper and Lower planes are blocked as well. While this setting has "Infernals" and "Angels" they are not the same thing.

* No Warlocks of the Celestial or of the Fiend

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/altered-content#no-dragons)No Dragons

Any dragon-related items would be antiques or already in a museum.

No Purple Dragon Knights, or at least they would need to be re-skinned.

No Dragonborn

Dragon ancestry sorcerers are rare, feared, and hated.

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/altered-content#the-fairy-gates-are-closed)The Fairy Gates Are Closed

The gates to the fey-wild are sealed preventing any travel in or out. The fey that remained trapped in the Material Realm at the time of closing are a changed lot. They still need to feed on the wonder of mortals but their mischief is much harder to get away with when they can't simply return home.

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/altered-content#ghosts-souls-and-spirits)Ghosts, Souls, And Spirits

This setting defines a Ghost as an Echo from The Fade, not the Ethereal. A Soul moves into the Ethereal where it is Reaped or hiding from the Reapers. A Spirit is an Astral entity, it's the manifestation of the concept of a person, place, or thing.
