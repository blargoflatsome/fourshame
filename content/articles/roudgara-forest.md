## Some History

Legend has it that the Spirit Mother once walked the earth in flesh and blood. A witch, to whom the forest owes its name, is said to have stirred a rebellion within Ravished. Her followers lived within these woods until the God-King Torquill personally lead his forces deep into its heart. There he found the Witch, Myrcella Roudgara, and bound her to a sacred tree before setting her ablaze. Thus ending her rebellion.

However, If you believe the Druids that still claim these woods, that is not the end of the story. They claim the soul of Roudgara lives on in the heart of the forest where they worship her as the reborn Spirit Mother.

## Government

Mother's Grove was built around the Myrcella Tree, said to house the soul of the Spirit Mother herself. Across the forest other groves have been established as well as the druids strive to push back The Black and blanket the forest in the Spirit Mother's influence.

Each grove lives mostly autonomous lives and pays no tribute to the central village but each grove is united under a singular faith and cause. It is rare, Under her leadership via the grove elders, that the groves come into direct conflict with each other. It is only in the most severe of circumstances that disputes are escalated to arbitration by the elders of Mother's Grove. Preferring instead to resolve disputes with feats of strength and sport; such as Skull Ball.

### Skull Ball

A popular sport and means of dispute resolution. Skull Ball is a way to earn renown during times of peace and to keep the young warriors from stirring up trouble in the forest or taking dangerous journeys into The Black in search of glory before they are ready. It also prevents bloodshed when two Groves have cause for dispute.

## Commerce & Currency

The Druids are largely self-sufficient and trade only among themselves with a simple barter system. Where outside resources are required they are obtained from the Grung, a local race of frog-like humanoids that serve the mother in their own way and deal with the outside world.

## Languages

Common, Dwarven, Gnome, Grung, Elven, Beast

## Points of Interest

### The Black

The Spirit Mother provides the light of the violescent plants to guide and protect her children in the unnaturally dark forest. The parts of the forest beyond her light are known simply as 'The Black'. Home to shadowmen and other dark horrors.

### The Spirit Gardens

The Groves of Roudgara Forest protect secret sites where the Druids among their number plant a seed that has been bonded to their own soul. As they grow and age so does the seed into a tree that mirrors their strength. Upon death, these druids do not pass on to the ethereal but instead possess their tree where they can be communed with and share their wisdom with their grove for so long as the tree lives.

## Factions of the Forest

### The Blight Sisters

The Blight Sister are profaned dryads that, if you believe the stories of Ludwig The Leprechaun, predate even the Spirit Mother. They hail from an ancient time when the forest held a different name and druids worshipped the Acorn God, also known as the Forest Father. 

They have demonstrated a deep connection and great power over their territories within the forest.

### The Spirit Mother

Goddess and guardian of the forest. The Spirit Mother is said to be the awakened spirit of Myrcella Roudgara, an Irishne elf that lead a rebellion against King Torquill Von Demillo of Ravished. Her life and her rebellion were ended when she was bound and burned upon a sacred tree. The druids of the forest serve her and her restless quest for vengeance.

### Gnomes

Forest Gnomes fled to the area during the Dragon Wars but have mostly been bred out by Rock Gnomes. The common Gnomes in the forest now are predominantly craftsmen who enjoy the protection of the groves while they experiment with the rare natural resources found in the forest.

### The Grung

The Grung honor the Spirit Mother in their own way, but they do not organize in groves or practice druid craft as the others do. They live in cities built on the high branches of massive trees, using local Goblinoids as slaves.

They also engaged in trade with factions outside of the Forest, such as gnoll slavers from the Forgotten Valley. This allowed the groves to remain hidden from the outside world but still engage in trade for foreign goods while also keeping the goblin population controlled.

That was before it was discovered they were selling the curse Evil waters in secret. The Spirit Mother's vengeance was dispatched upon the leaders of the grung, who were bound to trees and left to dry out in public display so that future generations would know and respect her ways. The groves also took a vote and determined to end their trade relations with the grung, opting to engage in trade directly at the risk of their obfuscation from the outside world.

Abandoned, reviled, and broken the grung are rarely seen these days.

### Shadowmen

Fearsome druidic tribes of the Black. Rarely seen until recently. Some say there are merely men like any other but the elders caution against such hubris. The Shadowmen are enemies of the Spirit Mother and abhor her light. Venture softly off the illuminated paths of the forest.

After an attack on the Spirit Garden of Wolf Grove, it's been revealed that the shadowmen can claim the loyalty of others by infecting them with Darkweed. Curing this affliction requires a rather expensive spell, Greater Restoration.

### The Beast Kings

Even the beasts answer to the Spirit Mother. The Beast Kings are awakened animals who tend to their own kind. Ensuring grievances are paid and their territories secured. Despite their awakening, they still operate by instinct and lack many humanoid notions. Such as good vs evil or love vs hate. They do, however, understand vengeance. For the mother taught them that.

### The Dwarves

The veiled mountains are so-called due to the thick mists, where freezing ice meets desert heat, that blankets them. The Dwarves of these mountains emerge from their earthen kingdoms only on occasion to trade with Umbrage Grove and from there the rest of the forest.

### The Tarsier

A small race of bardic creatures. Corruption had turned them all into Goblins, but upon her purification so to was the Tarsier returned to their natural state. At least physically. The psychological impacts may take some time.

## Unique Flora & Fauna

### Flora

Violescent plants grow low to the ground at the base of trees and light the dense forest as the thick canopy lets little natural light in. Several types of violescent can be identified by their unique glow. Each type has different traits that the druids have learned to harness in a variety of ways.

* Red Violescent

  * The liquid squeezed out of a Red Violescent root is highly poisonous and used to treat the Druids blow darts and spears. Like all Violecent pedals, they can be crushed into a paste and used to paint the faces of druid warriors. Causing them to glow crimson in the dark forests as they stalk their prey.
* Orange Violescent

  * Healing properties
* Green Violescent

  * Considered sacred.
* Blue Violescent

  * Poison
* Purple Violescent

  * Potent aphrodisiac
* Black Violescent

### Fauna

#### Head Hunter Spiders

Head-sized spiders that spin razor-sharp, nearly invisible, webs in straight lines connecting trees along forest walking paths. Should someone run past the razor web, and become decapitated, the spider nests within the neck of the corpse. Pulling the head down over the top of it, it can then animate the body and infiltrate human society. These spiders are sacred to the Spirit Mother and are only found in the Roudgara Forest.

#### Spider Bear

These creatures did not exist before the Spirit Mother took over the forest. They are more bear than spider but they hunt like a spider. Laying down thick webs around their lairs while they hibernate. Devouring whatever is trapped upon waking. Even the Druids shy away from these beasts.

#### Mothers Blight

A forest must be able to defend itself. To this end, a faction of druids known simply as the blight tends to their Mother's garden. They raise and watch over the Needle, Twig, and Vine Blights which serve The Spirit Mother. It is believed these blights hold back ancient enemies of the Forest. Creatures that once aided the Evil and stood against the Spirit Mother.

#### Crud Fish

Flesh-eating fish that lay tiny nearly invisible eggs that float on the surface of the water. If consumed the eggs hatch within the stomach acid of their new host. The newborn tadpoles launch into a feeding frenzy that results in horrible diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and in short order death. If the body is not placed in water the tadpoles die in the soil. If returned to water however they will grow until about the size of a fist and continue to feed on the meat of other fish, each other, animals that get too close to the water, and can even jump a short distance above the water to catch birds that swoop too close. To their credit Crud Fish are delicious if cooked properly.

## Celebrations

### The Hunt

When a child comes of age and graduates from their basic training (Reaches level 1) they are sent on a hunt. They are to hunt and kill a single animal to bring back for the feast, it is believed that the animal chooses them as well. At the end of the hunt a bond will form between the child, now an adult, and the beast they hunted. This bond allows them to communicate with all beasts of that type.

### Mother's Day

The anniversary of the Spirit Mother's awakening by fire.
