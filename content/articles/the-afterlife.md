## The Soul

The soul is a sentient divine energy that feeds upon the emotional exhaust put off by intelligent creatures. Divine energy must first find an intelligent creature to form a symbiotic bond with. This mostly happens during childbirth. As the child learns and grows, the soul’s core and skin form. Within that bond, it shares the experiences of the creature and is shaped by those experiences just as much as the creature is. The two become one, become something new.

When a body dies the soul departs, and its flesh decomposes. The soul retains memories but these memories fade over time without a physical mind to hold onto them. While the spell Speak With Dead can be used to gain access to the memories stored within the brain of a corpse, decomposition limits its effectiveness.

When a soul leaves its body it often looks like the body it left behind because of these shared experiences and may even believe itself to be the person it was. It shares their memories and can recall feeling emotions though it can't 'feel' any now. At least not naturally, it needs to feed to feel.

People tend to gravitate toward a certain emotion in life. They may seem bubbly and happy, or they may be depressed much of the time, or they seek thrills and danger. Whatever emotion drove (or haunted) a creature in life is simply the souls favored flavor. Just as the soul pursued that flavor in life, it will do so in death.

The concept of a 'psychic' vampire, someone who seems to leach the life out of a room, is simply a person with a gluttonous soul. It cannot get enough of the emotions it wants from its host, so it feeds on those around it. We can identify these people as our own souls will raise the hairs on our necks or make us feel uncomfortable in their presence as no soul wishes to share. Luckily a soul, once separated from the host, is quickly reaped. No matter how gluttonous. More on that later.

In the incredibly rare circumstance that a soul is not reaped for whatever reason, it will seek out the emotions it favored in life and strive to feel them again. A victim of suicide may linger near those it left behind, those its death hurt more than it realized it would. Feeding on their sorrow. If none exist it will seek out melancholy wherever it can find it. A person being haunted and fed on by a soul will find that emotion becomes enhanced as their own soul needs to influence it to produce more so as to keep itself sated. Until the haunting soul is removed the emotion will only grow stronger. This of course is true for happiness and other positive emotions as well. Resulting in thrill-seeking and drug abuse to achieve the ever-increasing demand. When someone you know has a sudden shift in personality, they may have a very hungry and unwelcome guest nearby. That said, any soul that lingers would find itself tirelessly pursued by the reapers. When a mortal speaks of 'ghosts' it's seldom an actual soul.

## Being Reaped

Raw Divine energy is just that, energy. It is the building blocks of life, raw potential. It gains sentience only when it forms a bond with a host and grows into a soul. It takes only a small amount to form the bond and as it feeds over the lifetime of a mortal it grows. This process is the only way to create more divinity. When a fully formed soul is broken back down to its raw state, it always produces more energy than it started with.

There is a race of creatures native to the Ethereal known as the Boer. They were a farming people until tasked with the solemn and sacred duty of farming the divinity that remained to Urroth.

The Boer can fill several occupations within the cities of the dead but the primary choices are to Cull or to Reap. A Reaper guides the souls of the dead back to the Isles of the Dead. A Culler watches for bad weather on the horizon and burns the crops to rejuvenate the soil. To put it another way, they cause the natural disasters that strike where overpopulation becomes a problem.

Reaped souls live for about 1,000 years when times are peaceful. Without the ability to feed on the emotions of the living their memory fades over this time in an unfortunate effect resembling Alzheimer’s. To ease this process every soul is instructed to write down the details of their life, and what knowledge they have gained over their existence. When the book is done, so is the soul. As the Soul transcribes their story they are in fact imprinting it into the book and losing awareness of it themselves. Unbeknownst to the Soul they are in fact cleansing and exhausting their energy. Should you ever see a soul writing in these books you would see the cleansed raw divine energy billowing up and away from the soul. As this happens the ethereal soul will wrinkle and shrink almost like a deflating balloon until it's nothing but an immobile husk. This husk is sent to a factory to be broken down and repurposed as building material.

These death books are then stored in libraries to be studied by the Boer. This way no life will fade from existence and be meaningless. The lands of the dead hold the truest and most vividly emotional first-hand accounts of Uroth’s history. To date, of the living, only members of the halfling race have ever been granted access to these libraries.

When a soul is damaged the divine energy within it also escapes. This energy is unclean, it still retains its experiences, memories, and emotional preferences. Yet, there is no known method of filtering this unclean energy from being sewn back into the living. This may result in people being born with innate affinities for certain skills, a haunted feeling they can't explain or a strong phobia, a sense of living a past life, or in extreme circumstances even developing personality traits of the original soul. Also, since the energy is scattered all across Urroth, one soul's experiences can inhabit many people even from completely different parts of the world. Nothing is to say that energy will be dispensed all at the same time either, so a soul from ages past who was not properly processed could resurface in the living of today. Due to this, the Boer takes the processing of souls incredibly seriously.

Not all souls go quietly. There is a city of the dead known to the Boer as Hell. Located in the charred lands beyond the charred mountain range. It is here that those troublesome souls and broken down by force and torture. Special care is taken to trap the energies released from these subjects and store them in barrels. Over time the memories will naturally degrade and the remaining energy can be released back into the world. The degraded memories and emotions form a sort of sludge at the bottom of the barrel that can be scraped up and processed into a rather potent drug.

## Cheating Death

A reaper that knows a soul's true name can speak the name and command the soul to follow. A soul that has had its true name spoken by a Reaper may not be resurrected as it lacks the free will to return. That said, the Reapers of the Boer are not infallible.

They are assigned to regions of the mortal world, and they do their best to keep track of the living. Attending births to hear the True Name assigned to a child by its mother and assigning that child to a specific reaper. A reaper may have many mortals under its charge that it must observe and upon their death take to the afterlife. A single Reaper will spread out its charges over time to help ensure multiple of its charges do not die at the same time. Upon the death of a charge, a reaper will become aware almost immediately and travel through the mists of the Ethereal to arrive at the location of the body. From there it is up to the reaper to track and claim the soul.

This process becomes difficult to manage as populations increase, as mortals discover better and faster ways to travel over greater distances in their lifetime, and as spell casters become more aware of their existence. To aid in keeping things within manageable parameters the Boer relies on cullers.

Cullers are talented observers of cause and effect. Nudge an arrow ever so slightly and even an unskilled archer can hit its target or a skilled archer could miss and hit an unintended target. If that target happens to be the only healer capable of curing a freshly born plague that will ravage the local population back down to acceptable numbers all the better. Some Cullers become so good at manipulating fate that many believe them capable of truly seeing the future.

Even so, no matter how unlikely, it is possible for a soul to slip through the cracks. At least for a time.

### Resurrection

Resurrection does not come without consequences.

The time a soul spends separated from the body creates a disconnect between the soul and the flesh. Suddenly the Soul has memories the flesh does not, even if it suppresses them there is always a lingering and unsettling sense of separation. The two do not truly return to being one. Physically this can manifest in several ways and each time a person is resurrected the disconnect becomes worse and worse.

A resurrected person may retain the ability to see and hear into the Ethereal. Distant whispers of the dead or even the taunting of its own reaper may plague its prolonged life. The barrier between the living and the dead further corrodes with every resurrection. In time the soul may become truly alien to the flesh. Simply a possessing passenger inside the host. This manifests itself in the soul being able to take limited amounts of control over the flesh; suppressing the body's memories causing a fugue state. The body and soul may even diverge on personality and agenda. Fighting over their course of action and control over the body. In-game terms the DM may wish to roll for the soul's intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma separate from the host to facilitate clashes of will and certain social skill checks.

Should one body become host to multiple souls either through possession, misused resurrection practices, or necromancy mishaps the body can develop a condition much like Multiple Personality Disorder. Hearing many voices, or being taken over by different Souls with unique personalities, skills, memories, and desires.

Keeping in mind that souls require emotions and that each soul prefers different flavors this disconnect is quite harmful to the host and its daily routine.

A Reaper who fails to reap is like anyone else when they fail at their job. Angry, ashamed, desperate to correct the mistake. Preferably before anyone notices. So in addition to all the above, the reaper will take an extra interest in the mortal's life. While not able to directly harm the cheater of death it will take any advantage it gains by that disconnect.

Should a reaper repeatedly fail to claim a charge, or a charge proves difficult to separate from its host, a culler will be dispatched to manipulate the mortal's fate. Bringing it into harm's way. Mechanically this can be handled by the DM gaining the Lucky Feat to use against the player. Cullers are not overly concerned about collateral damage, and may happily go to increasing extremes. Becoming a threat not only to the charge but to those around it as well. A reaper may also enlist the aid of additional reapers to subdue the charge upon its next death.

It goes without saying that a soul that cheats death simply by hiding and feeding upon the living is far easier to track and capture. This is why, apart from Revivify, no resurrection spells may function in this setting. Any soul that could be resurrected after the minute restriction of that spell is a point of plot and DM discretion. A generous DM may allow a character to roll stealth challenges to buy extra minutes for their party to cast Revivify, but keep in mind that the longer a soul is outside the body the more dramatic the impact of their resurrection.

There are other ways to cheat death, such as trapping your soul into an object or the clone spell which immediately shifts your soul into a cloned host. These bring their own unique challenges. The cloned body is, for example, younger than the soul. Perhaps much younger. The memories the soul possesses that the host does not will be difficult to access feeling more like a dream. Much of the detail slipping away entirely.

Those that create or utilize magical artifacts that trap souls upon death (either to harness the power for their own ends like a necromancer or to safeguard their soul from the reapers until a resurrection can be performed) will be assigned to a culler as well. Necromancers in Urroth must take extra precautions to safeguard themselves should their study advance beyond fiddling with the flesh.

## The Soulless

A host can live without a soul naturally of course. They are referred to as the 'soulless'. While not a direct threat to the Boer they are a sign of something gone wrong. They will not be hounded by the Boer but it is not uncommon for them to have narrowly survived a great tragedy following their birth as a culler attempted to correct the problem.

A soulless is largely considered unnatural by the living world as well and may fall prey to superstitions or be snatched up by any number of organizations for study. These practical threats aside, a soulless has certain other limitations to contend with.

### Limitations

They may not be benefited by divine means. They must instead rely on their hit dice, herbalism, long rests, and the powers of the grafters to be healed. In this setting divine spell casters, defined as those that use their own soul or raw divine energy to fuel their spellcasting ability, are Paladins, Druids, Mad Clerics, and Bards. This means that a soulless may not benefit from Bardic Inspiration, Lay on Hands, or even the Mad Cleric's Ritual Healing abilities. Nor may they be buffed by their spells. It also means a soulless may not gain levels in these classes.

No method of resurrection, short of a wish spell, may return a soulless to life after death.

### Benefits

Some benefits of being soulless are obvious, such as immunity to any spell that would target or trap a soul. For good or ill. A soulless is not just born without the divine spark that would grow into a soul, the body actively rejects it. This also makes them immune to possession by divine entities. Additionally, a soulless may only see, hear, or enter the Ethereal by means that transport the physical body into the ethereal plane or that utilizes some form of a physical conduit. Enchanted glasses that peer past the veil into the ethereal would work for a soulless, but any spell that would grant its own eyes that ability would fail.

Soulless also have Advantage on any save to resist the negative effects of divine spellcasting and have resistance to Radiant Damage.

Aside from mechanical changes, soulless tend to have fewer extremes in their emotions. They still have emotions, they can love and hate in equal measure. It's simply that without the soul's nagging hunger for emotions they trend toward being more rational or prone to obeying their baser instincts. In other words, soulless are unlikely to have chaotic alignments.

### You Can't Become Soulless

A body born with a soul is dependent on that soul. Should your soul be removed before the host dies, the host body will fall unconscious and if left that way will starve and die.

### You (Probably) Can't Become Soulless

That said, it is theoretically possible for a host to be trained to exist without a soul through prolonged and frequent experiences of having the soul removed and then placed back inside. As the disconnect between the host and soul grows the two may become independent of each other. A body that has adjusted to life without a soul in this manner does not reject divine energy it simply doesn't require it. Thus, it does not suffer the above negatives or gains the above benefits of being truly Soulless. The only change to the body when the soul is absent is the trend towards rationality over being emotional.

## The Nature Of Undeath

The most successful way to cheat death is by abandoning the soul completely.

When someone is transformed into an undead, such as a Vampire or Death Knight, their soul is still reaped. Death being paid, what the flesh does after that is none of the reaper's business.

Whatever the method of becoming a sentient undead, the animating component is replacing the soul with raw shadow stuff from the fade. Much the antithesis to divine energy; necrotic energy can bond with a host it just doesn't do so naturally and it is parasitic rather than symbiotic. The necrotic soul has no natural way to heal a host and will consume the flesh entirely if care is not taken to feed. This is why a zombie must consume flesh and a vampire drink blood. Even an undead that appears to have no sustaining hunger is driven to take life, their necrotic soul feeds upon the destruction even if the host is unaware of it.

Most forces outside of humanoids have no concept of good and evil. A sentient undead may salve whatever morality it clings to without any fuss from the necrotic soul growing within it; so long as the necrotic soul is fed. An undead who refuses to slate the darkness will find themselves consumed instead. The necrotic soul never believes itself to be one with the host and does not care if it dies. It merely feeds.

Once free of the host a necrotic soul may simply break down immediately, become a poltergeist, or in the case of Liches it will return to a phylactery until a new host presents itself. This setting does not change the way RAW undead work, it merely seeks to explain it in a way that a DM may be inspired to play with the expectations of their players.
