title: Races of Urroth
type: setting
metaDescription: An overview of the races that exist within the Urroth setting
  and how they may differ from RAW Dungeons and Dragons
---
A﻿ny race can be found within the setting of Urroth. However, not all of them share the same flavor text as RAW Dungeons and Dragons. It is also essential to keep the history of the world in mind, not all races are natural to this world.

A﻿fter the sundering the outsiders, warriors who caused the sundering, and refugees with the power to flee their own worlds as the void expanded, all ended up on Urroth. These people would have settled and procreated. Perhaps with others of their own species, perhaps not. Crossbreeding would have been very common, and even in cities primarily populated by a specific species, you can find among them genetic traces of their outsider ancestry.

T﻿he second historical event significant to race is the Dragon Wars. The Dragons pushed the populations of everything east of Helles Lichet down to Ravished over the span of 50 years. At the end of that time, the people spread back out across the continent, so who is to say what kind of unions could have formed during that time?

F﻿or these reasons, it is highly encouraged to get creative when defining your character. Even if merely in aesthetics. That said, we do have some generalizations about races specific to Urroth.

## E﻿lf
E﻿very elf on Urroth is descended from an outsider. The elves of Urroth were known as the Irishne and their kingdom was located in the Elderahl Forest. They were completely wiped out during the Dragon Wars.

A﻿s outsiders with very long life spans the population of elves on Urroth has never been very large, nor do they have any claim to territory or a homeland. So there are no elven kingdoms or purely elven settlements. The largest population of elves is in Thames, where many have found good work as butlers and staff in the wealthy houses of the humans. Their long life spans mean they can tend the homes and lives of these households over many generations.

A﻿s the people of Thames have turned their attention to the rest of the continent, forming adventuring bands, historical societies, and explorers. The elves of Thames may welcome the opportunity to join or even be sent along to continue their duties in watching over the families of their household.

A﻿s the history of Urroth is being uncovered, there have been whispers of a movement forming within the elven communities to head into Elderahl Forest and claim the lands of the Irishne. While the idea sounds good on paper, at this point few elves have ever lived a traditional elven forest lifestyle. Not to mention, not every elf outsider came from the same world. So even the traditional values and stories could be vastly different. 

If the elves of Urroth were to unite, they would largely be creating their culture from scratch.
