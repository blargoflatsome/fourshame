title: Races of Urroth
type: setting
metaDescription: An overview of the races that exist within the Urroth setting
  and how they may differ from RAW Dungeons and Dragons
---
A﻿ny race can be found within the setting of Urroth. However, not all of them share the same flavor text as RAW Dungeons and Dragons. It is also essential to keep the history of the world in mind, not all races are natural to this world.

A﻿fter the sundering the outsiders, warriors who caused the sundering, and refugees with the power to flee their own worlds as the void expanded, all ended up on Urroth. These people would have settled and procreated. Perhaps with others of their own species, perhaps not. Crossbreeding would have been very common, and even in cities primarily populated by a specific species, you can find among them genetic traces of their outsider ancestry.

T﻿he second historical event significant to race is the Dragon Wars. The Dragons pushed the populations of everything east of Helles Lichet down to Ravished over the span of 50 years. At the end of that time, the people spread back out across the continent, so who is to say what kind of unions could have formed during that time?

F﻿or these reasons, it is highly encouraged to get creative when defining your character. Even if merely in aesthetics. That said, we do have some generalizations about races specific to Urroth.

## E﻿lf

E﻿very elf on Urroth is descended from an outsider. The elves of Urroth were known as the Irishne and their kingdom was located in the Elderahl Forest. They were completely wiped out during the Dragon Wars.

A﻿s outsiders with very long life spans the population of elves on Urroth has never been very large, nor do they have any claim to territory or a homeland. So there are no elven kingdoms or purely elven settlements. The largest population of elves is in Thames, where many have found good work as butlers and staff in the wealthy houses of the humans. Their long life spans mean they can tend the homes and lives of these households over many generations.

A﻿s the people of Thames have turned their attention to the rest of the continent, forming adventuring bands, historical societies, and explorers. The elves of Thames may welcome the opportunity to join or even be sent along to continue their duties in watching over the families of their household.

A﻿s the history of Urroth is being uncovered, there have been whispers of a movement forming within the elven communities to head into Elderahl Forest and claim the lands of the Irishne. While the idea sounds good on paper, at this point few elves have ever lived a traditional elven forest lifestyle. Not to mention, not every elf outsider came from the same world. So even the traditional values and stories could be vastly different. 

If the elves of Urroth were to unite in this way, they would largely be creating their culture from scratch.

## Fey

T﻿he Fey of Urroth are different from RAW in one major way, they need wonder to survive. They are closed off from their own plane, and the material realm was never meant to house them for this long. It also means that they have had to adapt their way of life because they no longer have a realm to fall back too if their tricks get them in hot water.

**Wonder:** 
Wonder is a racial resource specific to the Fey of Urroth. As a tree creates oxygen the living creatures of the material realm create Wonder when their imaginations run wild.

> ***T﻿he following are untested theoretical mechanics for handling Wonder***

**Feed Action:**
**\*DC** (10 + Prof Bonus + Cha Mod)*
When a fey is near a target with an Intelligence score higher than 3 that is not of the creature types Fey, Undead, or Construct they may attempt to feed on them. To feed upon a target it must be in a deeply creative, or imaginative state; either from active speculation, obsessive curiosity, or terror. Feeding upon a target does not harm them but targets with a higher Intelligence are more likely to rely on reason than imagination so the target must roll an Int Saving throw vs the fey's Feed DC (10 + Prof Bonus + Cha Mod). The fey may attempt to impose Disadvantage on the target's Intelligence roll by first succeeding at a performance skill check vs the target's Passive Insight. 

If the target succeeds the fey is unable to gain any wonder from them. If the target fails the fey gains 1 point of Wonder. In either case, the target is immune to being fed on again until their next short or long rest.

**Max Wonder**
A fey may only hold onto a max amount of Wonder equal to their  Proficiency Mod at any given time.

**Unspent Wonder**
1 Unspent Wonder is lost at the end of every Long Rest. If the fey has no Wonder to lose, they begin to starve.

**Starving**
Fey still need to eat and sleep and are bound by those rules, but they also need Wonder to survive.

A fey can go without Wonder for a number of days equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a fey automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.  Having an Unspent Wonder to lose at the end of a Long Rest resets the count of days without Wonder to zero.

A fey may not gain more than 4 levels of Exhaustion from this flaw. So a fey that lives in solitude, maintains a healthy diet, and does not over-exert themselves, could remain at 4 Exhaustion indefinitely.

**The Power of Wonder**
The act of feeding on Wonder may give the fey Advantage on Insight checks against the target, as the Wonder will be flavored by their emotional state.

*Wonder may be spent to perform the following Actions:*

* Remove 1 level of Exhaustion
* Gain Prof Mod in temp hp
* Cast Disguise Self

*Wonder may be spent to perform the following Reactions:*

When an ally within 10ft of the fey casts a spell with a Spell Save DC, the fey may spend 1 point of Wonder to boost the targets Spell Save DC by an amount equal to the fey's Proficiency Bonus.
