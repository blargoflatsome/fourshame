# The Fade

> "Better to die than to merely fade away" - Anonymous

A land where the lost fade into oblivion. The Fade separates the Material Realm from the Necrotic. It's a realm of slow decay and darkness. Dread and sorrow. Where the material is broken down into its base components and discarded. While the astral realm is a realm of thought, the fae of wonder, and the Ethereal emotion. The Fade is where all those things go to die.

Much like the other realms, within the Fade exists a reflection of our own. These shadow cities contain the things we've lost and forgotten. Sometimes, even the people, or at least the echoes of people.

When a person dies with unfinished business those strong emotions bind with shadow to form Echoes. When an Echo resolves these emotions there is nothing left to bind them and they discorporate. The process appears as a light bursting from within them and escaping. This phenomenon is still being studied.

There is another way that echoes can be formed. When the strong emotions of those left behind bind to shadow. These echoes are not driven to appease the emotions that bind them but to torment their creators to keep those emotions going so they can remain. Often dragging them down into oblivion with them.
