> Renown is both your reputation and how you advance your character sheet. You will gain (and lose) Renown based on your deeds in game.

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/renown-xp-system#permanent-renown-pr)Permanent Renown (PR)

Your power comes from the forest and it is only by the will of the Spirit Mother that your power should increase. These blessings of the Mother leave a mark upon your soul that is detectable through a sort of sixth sense among your people. Your Permanent Renown is equal to your level. You cannot lose the Renown you gain from your level unless you lose a level.

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/renown-xp-system#temporary-renown-tr)Temporary Renown (TR)

Your reputation among your people is more fickle. While you will always be shown the respect your level deserves, Temporary Renown is how you stand out against your peers. Rated on a 1-5 scale temporary renown is earned and lost by your deeds. Every time you level up your Temporary Renown is reset to 0 and you must prove yourself worthy of both your new gifts and the gifts to come.

When socially interacting with other members of your tribe your Renown will determine how much respect and trust you are given as well as how much respect and trust is expected of you. When talking to someone with more Renown than you - you should show them the respect you expect from those of less Renown than you. Failure to respect your betters can result in the loss of Renown.

Sometimes what you ask for is simply too much even for one as Renowned as yourself. When you have a need that requires blind trust or loyalty and your words fail to be enough you can fall back on your previous deeds to sway your target. Effectively you are begging someone to do something they don't want to do. By calling on your previous deeds (expending Renown points) you lose Renown but in your willingness to do so sway your target. The DM will determine if this action can be performed and how much Renown you will need to burn in order to achieve your goal. In only the most extreme circumstances this could result in the loss of a level.

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/renown-xp-system#leveling-up)Leveling Up

You level up by the will of the Spirit Mother. When you have gained 5 TR you may cash them in to level up. Raising your Permanent Renown (PR) by 1 and resetting your Temporary Renown (TR) to 0. You may also be leveled up ahead of schedule by extreme feats that greatly impress the Spirit Mother or in time of dire need where your increased strength is required by the DM Spirit Mother.

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/renown-xp-system#mark-of-shame)Mark Of Shame

Should you fail the Spirit Mother in a spectacular way your village elder is empowered to punish you with the Mark of Shame. This is the gravest punishment your village can bestow upon you short of death. With the Mark of Shame your max TR is reduced to 4 and you may never gain another level until the mark is removed. Should you earn additional marks your TR cap will continue to be reduced by 1. Should your TR cap ever reach 0 you will become an enemy of the forest and all that the Spirit Mother commands will hunt you until dead or banished.

To remove a Mark of Shame you must either undo whatever it is you did to receive it or perform great deeds to prove yourself worthy once again. Often when a mark is bestowed the Elder will also give you a quest that will clear your honor.
