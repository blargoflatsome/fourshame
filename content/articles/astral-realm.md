The Astral Realm is a realm of thought. The collective consciousness of all thinking beings made manifest. It functions as a sort of membrane wrapped around everything like a skin to the Material Realm. It's how the Material Realm connects with the outer realms, or at least it was before the Outsider's destroyed those connections.

Where the Astral Realm meets the Material Plane it becomes what is known as the Dreaming. A place formed by and for the slumbering dreamers. Every dreamer has their own dreamscape, a place where they can sort and file away their memories and ideas. Some would call it a mind palace.

Where the dreamers gather in large quantities within the material realm the Dreaming takes on a more structured appearance. The buildings of the material world take form in the Astral creating hazy cities that those exploring the Astral Realm can visit and even live within.

Byways connect these Astral Cities as well as run even deeper into the Astral Sea. All the way to where the Astral Realm once connected to Outer Realms via great rainbow bridges; now long destroyed. The byways appear as roads, rivers, channels of wind, pretty much anything that can conceivably be a path. The only reliable distinguishing mark designating a byway is the lines of blue light on either side. The light is composed of all the hopes, wishes, and prayers of the dreamers being sent out to their gods. These lanes of light are called Faith Lines and the psychic blue energy is what gave the Gods their immense power.

The event known as the Sundering is when dreamers invaded the Astral Realm in their full physical form wielding horrifying power. Once inside they destroyed the rainbow bridges. Permanently cutting this Material Plane and all the others within this astral membrane from the outer realms.

The faith lines that ran along the rainbow bridges simply dumped all that psychic energy into the vast sea below. Yet, no power has ever gone unclaimed. As the waking world became aware of what was done the collective dread and despair from all these unanswered prayers turned that potent blue light into a thick congealed sludge.

The sludge didn't sink into the sea or evaporate over time, instead, it hardened as it pooled and piled until it formed a dark island under the bridges within the sea. As the stars began to wink out in the material sky the island grew and upon the island, horrors formed. In time a bright blue plant began to grow in the muck. It was thought to be a sign of hope, at first. Yet, when the Void was fully visible to the last tiny blue waking world the flower of hope bloomed bloody to reveal a clawing screeching creature so abhorrent none dared give it a name. Yet all knew it as Nightmare.

From that moment on the Astral Realm has been absolute chaos and the waking world was launched into a cycle of fear and paranoia known to the dreamers as The Dark Ages. By the time the Dragons arrived in the Material Realm the forces fighting against Nightmare had all but lost. Down to the last with no heroes insight to spark hope back into the dreamers. Nightmare wasted no time creating horrors of the Dragons to torment the dreamers by night.

Yet in the bleakest of moments, the spark of hope shines brightest. A new entity suddenly made itself known. It called itself "the producer".

The Producer realized that the war effort was a losing battle. Fear was everywhere, for good reason, and Nightmare's army was endless. Yet, the producer reasoned, if they focused their efforts on influencing the dreamers instead of fighting the horrors directly; maybe they could turn the tide.

To prove this theory the Producer entered the dreams of a man named Atekna and put on the first Dream Play. A scripted dream designed to inspire this man to greatness. Admittedly, there were some details lost in translation and the man went quite a bit more mad than intended and regrettably died at one point... but with some further prodding and by pulling a few strings here and there he did discover the ritual that ultimately defeated the Dragons! This was a massive turning point for two reasons.

Reason number one... it gave hope and joy back to the dreamers. They began to fight back. The second reason was the trick. You see the Dragons had created armies of their own. The Infernals were just more nightmare fuel, but the Angelics were already inspiring hope everywhere they went. So, when the ritual was enacted it banished the most powerful Dragons to prisons they could never escape. and cast the Infernals into the deepest pits of the Material Realm where they can do nothing but war upon each other and be forgotten. The Angelics however, came to the Astral Realm.

Still banished from the Material Realm, they became astral natives. It was messy at first but when they saw what was actually going on, behind the curtain, they took up arms with pride. Between the reinforcements and the spark of hope firmly lit within every dreamer the tides of war shifted.

Nightmare still has the advantage of numbers but the Angels have gained a stronghold in the mists of Thames as well as postings in every major nation of the dreamers. The waking world is now in a time of renascence and hope.
