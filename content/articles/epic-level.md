## What is Renown

Renown is a homebrew alternative experience point system. Renown is earned in game when players do something awesome. This can be anything from engaging in Roleplay, to finding a creative solution to an issue, resolving a major or personal plot point, or any other behavior you wish to encourage at your table.

Players may also nominate each other for Renown when they see someone do something awesome. This makes gaining experience a matter of player bonding and reward.

Renown can be spent in a number of ways, not just for leveling up. This combines D&Ds normal Level Up system with the customization options of a Point Buy system. Allowing characters to train during play in specific ways to fine tune their character outside of their class level progression.

Renown allows you and your table to set the standards of play by rewarding desired behavior with the most precious commodity in the game; Experience Points.
