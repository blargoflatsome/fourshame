If you are new to our stream, you likely have questions. Keep reading as we try to clarify some things.

## What is Roudgara?

The Roudgara Forest is the primary location and focus of this campaign. At the start of the campaign, it was only known as a cursed/haunted forest to those outside of it. The forest is claimed by the kingdom of Ravished which borders its southern edge. By law of this kingdom travel into the forest was forbidden.
The players originally took on the role of residents of the forest, and a lot has changed from this original premise. Including engaging with the outside world, and they have uncovered the truth of what haunts these woods and now stand against it.

## What is the objective of Chapter 4?

The party has made many waves within the forest, but at the end of Chapter 3, those waves came crashing down. The Spirit Mother finally took direct action against them. Chapter 4 finds them fleeing from their home to regroup and heal their wounds. Each character has their own personal goals, but as a group, they are united in ridding the forest of the profane influences that have plagued it for hundreds of years. This means dealing with the two remaining Blight Sisters; Misery and Betrayal. Only when they have been purified or killed, can they take on the sister’s father Tut.


Hadriana Ravensight-Pren seeks to conquer the forest and make it her own. More than that, she has begun pursuing exchanging the life of the last living dragon (and progenitor of her sorceress bloodline) Fetek, in exchange for the people of Roudgara Forest to be recognized as their own nation.


Remi continues to serve as an agent of death, or more specifically a culler named Earnest Clay and a reaper named Roger. She has recently regained the memories of her family from a hag of the fade named Mayme, only to discover that her mother had passed away but her soul is awaiting her at the necropolis she helped establish.


Emmerson, a loyal and devoted warrior of the Spirit Mother’s own grove, has just had his reality shattered. Witnessing firsthand the brutality of her vengeance as she turned on her own people, including him. Yet, with his shovel of Justice, he struck blood from the Spirit Mother just before everyone made their escape. He now stands at the crossroads of justice and vengeance.

## What is the Spirit Mother?

The people of Roudgara Forest have long served an entity known as The Spirit Mother. She brought light to the unusually dark forest in the form of bioluminescent plants locally called ‘Violescents’, and they learned to use these plants in many other ways. From herbal healing remedies to war paint. 
All that the mother asked for in return, was vengeance. 

The Spirit Mother is believed to be the spirit of a druid rebel named Myrcella Roudgara. She lead a rebellion against a great hero of the Dragon Wars, and king of Ravished, named[ Torquill Von Demillo](/characters/torquill-von-demillo). It was her belief that he poisoned the land with his reckless pursuit of necromancy during the “Time of Atrocities”.
She lost that rebellion, as Torquill marched on the forest with his “Crimson Guard” in their burning armor. As she watched her people die, Myrcella was bound to a sacred tree and set aflame. An event that the kingdom of Ravished still celebrates to this day with a yearly fire festival, which includes ‘burning back’ the forest.
As the flames licked away her flesh, the spirit of Myrcella possessed the forest with her will and her rage.

The party has, however, discovered that this is not the full story. In truth, Myrcella was deceived by The Blight Sisters into thinking the evil that plagued the forest was the fault of necromancy, but in truth, it was the very same profane power that twisted the three dryads so long ago. Myrcella was actually an even-headed and fair elven woman until the sisters conspired to drive her and the forces of Ravished into greater conflict.


Myrcella had a son, Therodin, who was cursed by the sisters and secreted away in a cave. They let Myrcella believe her son was executed by the forces of Ravished, and in her grief vengeance claimed her heart.
King Torquill also had a son, of sorts, a childer. Torquill has obscured this secret to history, but he is (or was?) a vampire. His childer, Demetri, entered the forest to deal with the rebellion but also never returned. He shared the curse that befell Theodin.


The conflict that then ignited sated and nourished the roots of the Blight Sisters until that fateful evening when Myrcella was set aflame on Misery’s tree. An act that joined the two as one, and they became The Spirit Mother.

##  Who are the Blight Sisters?

Within the forest exist three extremely old and powerful dryads called “The Blight Sisters”. The daughters of a satyr named Tut; the blight sisters were once known as Joy, Kindness, and Purity. However, an illness swept over the forest and the acorn god had abandoned them. So Tut turned to something darker, known as The Profane or The Whispering Dark, Tut enacted profane rituals upon his daughters. While he did save them from the plague, the evil of his actions twisted them and they are now known as Misery, Betrayal, and Corruption. 

As for Tut, he was stripped of his joy and remains locked away in an ancient temple of his long-gone acorn god.

The truth of the sister’s was revealed to the party by a spriggan named Ludwig, who told them the sisters could be cleansed of their evil. The party had to anoint the tree of Corruption in the tears of a newborn baby and its mother upon first seeing each other. This they did in Chapter 2, and Corruption is once again Purity.

To Betrayal, also known as The Lady of Thorns, they only know that “All Secrets Must Be Revealed” before her tree. 

To Misery, whom they have discovered is actually The Spirit Mother, they were told “An Act of True Love” must be performed before her tree.

## Where did the Gods go?

This is meta knowledge, but the basis of this homebrew world are the campaigns that the DM Jordan played in growing up with his older brother Jade. The final campaign, before life got in the way and they stopped playing D&D, ended with them destroying the Astral Bridges to the outer planes. Cutting the world of Urroth off from the rest of the planes/worlds and Gods. This setting is an imagining between Jordan and Jade of what would have happened after that. 

The timeline has been advanced to a new era where the world has mostly recovered from the loss of true gods, but its a world held together by magical duct tape and glue.


So, the truth is the Gods didn’t abandon the world. Adventurers cast them out. This event is known as ‘The Sundering’ to the rare few who know of it.

## What are the Dragon Wars?

Dragons require food, and as the Void swallowed world after world in the aftermath of the Sundering food became scarce. This brought two factions of dragons to Urroth, one side led by a silver dragon named Orom. The other was led by a red dragon named Uralom. As the dragons fought over territory and food, the people of Urroth were caught in the middle. This war lasted for 50 years and caused the extinction of Giants and the native elves of Urroth known as the Irishne.


The Dragon Wars were ended by an Outsider named Torquill Von Demillo. He was defeated by the black dragon Fetek but escaped down to a kingdom known as Ferenia. There he rose in power until he was able to sanction the open use of necromancy to find a solution. This time period is now known as the “Time of Atrocities”, but with an army of undead, Torquill was able to turn the tides of the war until a ritual was enacted that banished Orom and Uralom, as well as their hordes of mutations known as the Infernals and Angelics. Dragons have since been hunted to extinction, or so everyone thought.

## Who is Fetek?

Fetek is a black dragon, a malevolent and evil creature dating back to the time of the Dragon Wars. He was locked away and forgotten deep beneath Castle Tor, but a human bloodline of his escaped Tor. This bloodline is what became the Uruk of the Blodwoods, and the ruling family, The Pren, of Roudgara Forest.


Hadriana, a member of the Pren family and therefore a descendant of Fetek, has discovered the dragon and drank of his blood on two separate occasions. Each time the draconic nature of her blood has become more pronounced. She had long wrestled with what to do about Fetek, but at the end of Chapter 3, she committed herself to having the last of the dragons executed. Now, she and her allies just have to figure out how to kill such an ancient creature. Even bound in chains, Fetek is a force of great power.
