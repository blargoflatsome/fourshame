## Premise

In a cursed forest many years ago there lived 3 dryad sisters; Joy, Purity, and Kindness along with their satyr father Tut. A plague had spread across the forest that no man, beast, or fey could resist. The gods themselves had abandoned the forest, and no natural remedy could be found.

So Tut, fearing for his ailing daughters, turned away from Nature to its opposing source of power. The Whispering Dark, also known simply as the Profane. Upon his three lovely daughters, he performed vile rituals, forever corrupting their virtue, mind, and form. Joy, Purity, and Kindness became Misery, Corruption, and Betrayal. Known now to history as the Blight Sisters.

For himself, Tut sacrificed the druids that once served him, and in so doing his avarice and vice turned to melancholy and tears. If by choice or by some cruel twist it is unclear; Tut, now known to very few as Regret, remains forever lost to the world within those hallowed halls buried beneath the forest floor. Listen closely upon the ground and you may yet hear him there, weeping.

Fast forward to a mere three hundred and some odd years ago, just as the Dragon Wars were heating up. An Irishne woman by the name of Myrcella Roudgara, with the pointed ears and wood-grained skin common among her kind, arrived in these same cursed woods. Known by then as the Whispering Forest. There she took in refugees found along their travel south to the kingdom of Ravished and offered them an alternative way of life. The life of the druid… in service to a trinity of forest spirits.

By the end of the Dragon Wars, this peaceful, nurturing, woman and her druids were set to violence. Claiming that the necromantic practices of Ravished used to end the Dragon Wars had corrupted the very land and water. Her rebellion was short-lived, as the noble King of Ravished marched his Crimson Guard into the Whispering Forest leaving not but ash and bone wherever they went.

Myrcella herself was bound to a sacred tree, Misery's tree, and upon it, she too was burned. Though some say the fires burned only half as hot as her heart. If indeed she screamed at all within those flames it was merely a cry for vengeance.

Despite the laws of Ravished forbidding travel within the forest even to the present day, more lost souls have found their way into those cursed woods. Known now as the Roudgara Forest.

Though these modern druids know little of the trinity once served by Myrcella, they claim to be guided by a singular entity known to them as the Spirit Mother. She does not teach them the ways of peace or tranquility, her druids do not respect the balance of Nature or the circle of life. The Spirit Mother knows but one path that all within her canopy follow. The path of vengeance.

It is here that our campaign started.

## Chapter One

Our party consists of Hadriana Ravensight (a fisherman's daughter), Isaterra (the first gnome to take up the druidic path), Thaishin (a chosen child of the Spirit Mother and raised by the grove Elder), and Muspella (a mysterious child with horns and cloven hoofs found abandoned in the forest and raised by the barbarian war chief Gerald Stumpton).

Early in the adventure the forest is invaded by orc outsiders, though due to a language barrier it is unclear as to why. Not that it mattered, the rules were clear. Kill the outsiders. Perhaps, had the party obeyed the rules a lot of suffering could have been avoided but upon discovering one of the orcs was pregnant, a simple choice was made that has altered the path of history forever. The baby was spared, even named. Elpis.

As the orcs increased their attacks, another outsider was discovered and spared. Killian Gren, a member of the Keepers of the Dark, was searching for his sister when he was captured by Gerald Stumpton. The party pressed for staying his execution and helping him find his sister; Chloe. In so doing they discovered that the grung were selling cursed water from The Evil to outsiders. The Spirit Mother's vengeance laid their civilization to waste, but Killian and Chloe were reunited.

Killian knew of the orcs and where they came from, and as repayment for his life and the life of his sister; offered to escort the party out into the Forbidden Valley in order to uncover the source and reasoning for their attacks.
