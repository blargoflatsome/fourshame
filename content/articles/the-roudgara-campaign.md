## Premise

In a cursed forest many years ago there lived 3 dryad sisters; Joy, Purity, and Kindness along with their satyr father Tut. A plague had spread across the forest that no man, beast, or fey could resist. The gods themselves had abandoned the forest, and no natural remedy could be found.

So Tut, fearing for his ailing daughters, turned away from Nature to its opposing source of power. The Whispering Dark, also known simply as the Profane. Upon his three lovely daughters, he performed vile rituals, forever corrupting their virtue, mind, and form. Joy, Purity, and Kindness became Misery, Corruption, and Betrayal. Known now to history as the Blight Sisters.

For himself, Tut sacrificed the druids that once served him, and in so doing his avarice and vice turned to melancholy and tears. If by choice or by some cruel twist it is unclear; Tut, now known to very few as Regret, remains forever lost to the world within those hallowed halls buried beneath the forest floor. Listen closely upon the ground and you may yet hear him there, weeping.

Fast forward to a mere three hundred and some odd years ago, just as the Dragon Wars were heating up. An Irishne woman by the name of Myrcella Roudgara, with the pointed ears and wood-grained skin common among her kind, arrived in these same cursed woods. Known by then as the Whispering Forest. There she took in refugees found along their travel south to the kingdom of Ravished and offered them an alternative way of life. The life of the druid… in service to a trinity of forest spirits.

By the end of the Dragon Wars, this peaceful, nurturing, woman and her druids were set to violence. Claiming that the necromantic practices of Ravished used to end the Dragon Wars had corrupted the very land and water. Her rebellion was short-lived, as the noble King of Ravished marched his Crimson Guard into the Whispering Forest leaving not but ash and bone wherever they went.

Myrcella herself was bound to a sacred tree, Misery's tree, and upon it, she too was burned. Though some say the fires burned only half as hot as her heart. If indeed she screamed at all within those flames it was merely a cry for vengeance.

Despite the laws of Ravished forbidding travel within the forest even to the present day, more lost souls have found their way into those cursed woods. Known now as the Roudgara Forest.

Though these modern druids know little of the trinity once served by Myrcella, they claim to be guided by a singular entity known to them as the Spirit Mother. She does not teach them the ways of peace or tranquility, her druids do not respect the balance of Nature or the circle of life. The Spirit Mother knows but one path that all within her canopy follow. The path of vengeance.

It is here that our campaign started.

## Chapter One

Our party consists of Hadriana Ravensight (a fisherman's daughter), Isaterra (the first gnome to take up the druidic path), Thaishin (a chosen child of the Spirit Mother and raised by the grove Elder), and Muspella (a mysterious child with horns and cloven hoofs found abandoned in the forest and raised by the barbarian war chief Gerald Stumpton).

Early in the adventure the forest is invaded by orc outsiders, though due to a language barrier it is unclear as to why. Not that it mattered, the rules were clear. Kill the outsiders. Perhaps, had the party obeyed the rules a lot of suffering could have been avoided but upon discovering one of the orcs was pregnant, a simple choice was made that has altered the path of history forever. The baby was spared, even named. Elpis.

As the orcs increased their attacks, another outsider was discovered and spared. Killian Gren, a member of the Keepers of the Dark, was searching for his sister when he was captured by Gerald Stumpton. The party pressed for staying his execution and helping him find his sister; Chloe. In so doing they discovered that the grung were selling cursed water from The Evil to outsiders. The Spirit Mother's vengeance laid their civilization to waste, but Killian and Chloe were reunited.

Killian knew of the orcs and where they came from, and as repayment for his life and the life of his sister; offered to escort the party out into the Forbidden Valley in order to uncover the source and reasoning for their attacks.

While the journey would prove to be long and incredibly dangerous, each of our heroes brought with them their own baggage. 

Hadriana had learned the truth of her draconic heritage and met the spirit of her mother now bound to a tree within the Spirit Garden. The truth revealed itself by way of the wings that burst out of her back; wings that would have gotten her killed if not for her mother's magic ring that cloaked her draconic features in illusions. So long as she never let anyone get too close, that is.

Isatera and Thaishin had both received gifts in the form of necklaces, gifts found seemingly at random but that granted great power. It was Ludwig, a fey creature, that revealed to the party that the necklaces came from ancient and powerful forces within the forest known as "The Blight Sisters". It was his claim that these sisters were profaned by their father in dark rituals, but that they could be purified.

Muspella learned the truth of her lineage when she was gifted items found with her as a baby. Including a ring that contained the spirit of her father. A spirit that wished to be set free and placed into a new body.

During their time outside of the forest the party met with centaurs, visited the homeland of Gerald Stumpton known as Knossoss the Minotaur city, and detoured to Glandor to meet the lich Victor Dark. 

While in Glandor they learned it was the lich who had been purchasing the cursed water from the grung, and used it to create undead that could work the soil without fear of the arcane storm that ravages the Forbidden Valley. The lich owed a debt to Muspella's father, and agreed to return the man to life but not before an entity known as Charlie Zane, a "tempter demon", revealed himself to rest of the party in secret and offered them their hearts desire if they allowed her father to perish once the ritual was done. 

His temptations were pointless in the end, as it was Muspella herself that condemned her father's soul to damnation. Opting, out of fear of what he might be, to destroy the ring that housed his soul before he could be returned to life. Ending her father's quest for redemption.

Tragedy plagued the party from then on it seems, as Isaterra began clashing more and more with what she perceived to be the immoral choices and chaotic nature of the party. They were nearly to the Bronze City, home of the orcs, when her will lost out and her body was taken over by the blight sister known as Corruption. She attacked the party but was ultimately taken down and stolen away by a mysterious creature named Farlan. Farlan pulled her into the fade, claiming he would help her but that the party needed to get back home and deal with the Blight Sisters.
