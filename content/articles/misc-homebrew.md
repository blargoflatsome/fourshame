## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/miscellaneous-homebrew-mechanics#inspiration)Inspiration

Inspiration may be used to gain Advantage on your next roll but must be declared before your roll.

You never have more than 5 Inspiration at a time. These Inspiration points may be used to 'haggle' with the DM to influence the narrative. This may be to allow you an action you wouldn't normally get because it would be cool for the scene or character, or even to influence something such as 'if I give up 2 inspiration could there be a toolkit training book on this bookshelf?'

### [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/miscellaneous-homebrew-mechanics#supernatural-patrons)Supernatural Patrons

You may communicate with your supernatural patrons at the cost of 2 Inspiration points.

* **The Drum Beats of Creation**

  * By spending 2 inspiration you may commune with your muse for 10 minutes once per day to uncover a truth of the universe. The truth will not be fully revealed to you until you also complete a work of art, but in that art the answers will be apparent to you. The Target Number of creating the art will be set based on the Truth you are looking to reveal.
  * Some truths may require additional inspiration per the DM's discretion.
  * Works of Art created this way are called "Inspired Art" and any who look upon them must make a Charisma Save or become entranced by the work for 1 minute. Any you uncover the 'question' in that time may also learn the answer. If they are told the question, they are immune to this effect.
* **Angel: Justice, Blood of Orom**

  * By spending 2 inspiration during a long rest the character may enter the Dream Space and ask 1 question.
  * The answer may come in the form of a cryptic dream, or an Angel may speak to the dreamer directly. If an Angel speaks to you directly, you will gain 1 Exhaustion at the end of your long rest.
  * Some questions may require additional inspiration per the DM's discretion.
* **Culler: Earnest Clay**

  * By spending 2 inspiration when someone near you dies, you may summon your patron and request one favor.
  * Some favors may required additional inspiration per the DM's discretion
  * Example Culler Favors

    * You may reroll 1 fumble before your next long rest.
    * DM rerolls 1 Crit before your next long rest.
    * Give one creature Disadvantage on one roll before your next long rest.

A Book of Lore grants a +1 to any Intelligence roll based on the subject matter of the book. Each use of the book takes up one of its 5 charges. When all charges are used up, you have learned all you can from the book.

**Oil.** You can pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area.

**Tinderbox.** This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

**Alchemist's Fire.** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

**Fireball**The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

Flammable for game purposes will be obvious items like dry grass, leaves, paper, curtains, etc.

Doors, trees, wooden floors, and the like will merely be scorched black unless the fire lasts for a minimun of two rounds. Such as if Oil was applied.At the start of the second round it would have a 10% chance of catching the objects on fire, which could then spread at the top of the following round. If it does not the oil would simply putter out at the end of its second round.

| Total Fire Size | Chance of Spread | Spread Roll |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 1               | 10%              | 1d4         |
| 4               | 20%              | 1d6         |
| 8               | 40%              | 1d10        |
| 16              | 80%              | 1d12        |
| 32              | 100%             | 1d20        |

## [](http://localhost:3000/houserules/miscellaneous-homebrew-mechanics#resurrection-view-dndbeyond-)Resurrection \[View @DndBeyond ]

You have died and thru mystical means returned to life. However, the experience of a soul separating from the flesh for the first time is not one recovered from lightly. The body and soul, once a bonded unit, are now two. The soul never again feels fully comfortable in the meat machine that it occupies.

A resurrected character suffers a -1 to their Constitution and may not raise this attribute above a 19. This represents the persistent discomfort and knowledge that the body and soul are separate entities.

This separation also brings an extra awareness of the Ethereal Realm.

**Spiritual Senses:** As an action you may forgo your earthly awareness and instead perceive the spiritual world aka the Ethereal Realm. This action requires concentration to maintain. It does not give you the ability to see invisible creatures. While you can see and hear into the Ethereal Realm you have disadvantage on perception and investigation rolls in the Material Realm.
