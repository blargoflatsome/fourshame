  "content": "# Welcome to 4 Shame Not Honor!\n\nWelcome, Adventurers! If you enjoy interacting with drunks that delve into dungeons look no further! \\\nThis is a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Homebrew that streams every Sunday!\n\nThe game is set in a world called Urroth, and it is the culmination of nearly 20 years of drunk D&D play. Our DM Jordan began playing in his brother's D&D games, but over the years their adventures would make quite a mess of the place. So, when the time came for Jordan to take on the mantle of DM he decided to pick up where his older brother left off. They worked together to create a setting based on the years they played D&D together, and to advance the timeline in order to pave the way for new adventurers.\n\nWill they heal the damage wrought by heroes past, or wreak their own paths of destruction? \n\nTune in every Sunday atÂ [twitch.tv/fourshamenothonor](https://www.twitch.tv/fourshamenothonor) to find out!"
