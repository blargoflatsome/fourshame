  "content": "## 4ShameNotHonor LLC\n\nKayla and Jordan formed the 4ShameNotHonor LLC after our Sunday D&D game gained enough attention on twitch to go affiliate during the onset of the pandemic. Thankfully, we have managed to keep it going even as we all had to return to work and resume normal schedules. Give or take a few cast changes along the way.\n\nWe are excited to see our stream grow, but mostly we just enjoy the opportunity it has given us to enjoy Sunday evenings with our friends and to make new ones.\n\n## Merchandise\n\nTo help fund our efforts, new equipment, upkeep subscriptions, etc we have also created a[ 4shameNotHonor store ](https://4-shame-not-honor.creator-spring.com/)on teespring! If you don't see anything you like, feel free to request something on our Discord Serve!\n\n## Join Our Discord!\n\nIf you would like to get to know us better, you can find us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WVkMgSvRFR)! It is also the best way to stay on top of everything that we have going on, and to ask any questions you may have about the stream, the game, or the characters.\n\n## Show Your Support\n\nWe quite honestly just appreciate anyone who comes by and engages with chat, but if you feel like you want to support us with bits or subscriptions we are deeply flattered and it helps us keep doing this. If you want to do more we do have a [Paypal Donation](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/4Shame) page setup as well.\n\n## Partnership with RolePositiveGaming\n\nSpeaking of new friends, and helping our stream grow, we have joined our community with the very talented people over on [RolePositiveGaming](https://www.twitch.tv/rolepositivegaming). Kayla is now a player in their Friday game, and both Jordan and Kayla play in the Monday game. You should absolutely check them out!"
