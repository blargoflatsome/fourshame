My name is Kayla (she/her) and im a 31 yr old goth living in Portland, OR. 
I've loved everything fantasy for as long as I can remember and it is still my main hobby and enjoyment to this day. Greek mythology is my favorite overall subject. Lord of the Rings was my first obsession. Game of Thrones was my first book series to read at least 5 or 6 times, and I have a tattoo to commemorate each one. Wanna see? Just ask! 


What's ironic is that I didnt end up finding DND until about 2018, but i've been absolutely hooked ever since. 
My first PC was an elf war cleric named Belladonna, but my longest played PC is a human sorceress of draconic lineage named Hadriana Ravensight. Ive been playing Hadriana for about 3 years in a weekly Sunday game that moved to streaming once Covid hit.
