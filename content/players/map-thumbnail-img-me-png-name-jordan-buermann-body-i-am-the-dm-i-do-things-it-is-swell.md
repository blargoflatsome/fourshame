I am the DM of 4ShameNotHonor!

I started playing D&D when I was 13 playing in my older brother's Advance Dungeons and Dragon's campaigns (that later turned into 3.5 campaigns), which served as the basis for the homebrew world that I run on stream. When my brother got married and started having kids, it was difficult to get games together so I joined a local Vampire the Masquerade LARP... which was my first and only LARP experience. Apparently, I enjoyed it as I then became the head storyteller of it for roughly 10 years.

When I moved to Portland back in 2019 I found a group in need of a DM, so I agreed to run something in 5th edition. I hadn't really ever run D&D before, and it was interesting returning to table top versus a LARP setting, but so far so good!
