A DM in players clothing, André has been playing and DMing D&D for almost 20 years. Some of the highlights of my D&D resume:

* Has DM'd 4 separate campaigns to meaningful completion
* Has played with the same group of players (+ or - a player here and there) for about 15 years
* Has a [completely homebrew campaign setting](http://apocalypticaarcanum.com/) that is revisited often
* Is not a rules lawyer or a backseat DM (but sometimes I pretend to be on stream)
* Believes the world would be a better place if more people played Druids
* Literally always has a one-shot on standby.. ..just in case

When not on stream you can probably find me discussing at length the lore, philosophy and history of almost any fantasy or science fiction universe ad nauseum.
