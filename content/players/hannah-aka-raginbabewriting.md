Hannah has been a nerd for as long as she can remember, tied up in stories of any medium. A long-time lover of fantasy, sci-fi, and history. She has spent a long time headed directly toward the wider world of tabletop roleplaying.

Her love of history was the first deep dive into her nerdy interests. She was *absolutely* the kid that just said all the answers into the waiting silence of any history lesson/class she ever had. Fantasy and Sci-fi (well Lord of the Rings) came immediately after that, but the love of books and writing has been long since instilled. She’s a writer, historian, and poet. Hannah has been working for more than a decade on her own fantasy trilogy! 

It was during her thesis “research” (meaning that a computer was in front of her and the internet took her mysteriously to YouTube, and Pinterest) that she first discovered a group of nerds playing dungeons and dragons. Having only ever role-played in long-form prose (think Goodreads circa 2005?) the world and mechanics of D&D meant absolutely nothing to her, and she could not even fathom the ways that the game would go on to change her life.

That was four years ago. Now, I'm streaming in my own games. Character voices, tears, laughter, and tables both digital and physical fill my life. From there I’m not ashamed to say that I learned pretty much the vast breadth of my knowledge of D&D and its rules from various actual play shows.

After simply watching more than 700 hours of gameplay it’s fair to call it more than a passing knowledge. Do not be afraid to start running your own games that way! That’s how I started! People are happy to be characters as long as you are happy to tell a story.

Telling good stories is how I got involved with streaming, and actual play! First with RolePositiveGaming! Bryn the Half-Orc Abjuration Wizard (where Kayla and I play), Edie the Druid/Warlock combo, and now, as Mirriam the dwarf Rune Knight, I’m here with the lovely people of 4ShameNotHonnor

(Yes, all of these characters should probably seek some kind of therapy, but that’s how you KNOW it’s good. When love, sadness, and traumas, all get thoughtfully and lovingly mixed into the backstory while your GM cackles with joy from afar.)
