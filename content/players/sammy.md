Hey! I’m Sam or Sammy (he/him), either is fine. I am the newest member to the 4ShameNotHonor crew. I live across the pond in the North West of England, in a place called The Lake District – it’s a beautiful place! Perhaps a stark contrast to the dark and gloomy Roudgara Forest actually haha.

I’ve pretty much been a nerd my entire life. I was a dinosaur kid, and also the kid that would talk through his toys and make them fight each other (don’t judge me). However, it did take me a little while to find D&D. Ironically, it was my good friend Jordan (he runs a monthly campaign over on Bridges & Brigands btw) that did it back in 2015, after some serious convincing. I was very shy and awkward at first, as I’d never really done anything like that at the time. I was like a fish out of water. 

Eventually, in around 2020 I found Critical Role and witnessed the magic of what a heavy roleplaying game looked like with a large emphasis on the player narratives. I wanted that, and I learned from them in the process, which got me out of my shell a little bit. In 2021, I found Matt over at Role Positive Gaming, and the Strixhaven game that runs over there was birthed. Matt really immersed me, not only into his world, but also into that heavy roleplay environment that I just mentioned.

Since then, I’ve only continued to grow in confidence at the “table” and now I can’t get enough roleplay in my life. However, having said that, I do enjoy all facets of a D&D game. Again, since I was a kid, I’ve always had a brain for maths and mechanics and so the numbers and combat strategies all fascinate me. That part of the game is equally as enjoyable, and of course, I love the exploration and puzzle aspects of D&D as well.


I feel really honoured and privileged to be part of this game, and Jordan’s world. It has been very apparent from the outset how much love and passion has gone into this game, setting and all the different characters. I hope my character Dante can help enhance that, and hopefully everyone watching enjoys what I bring to the table
