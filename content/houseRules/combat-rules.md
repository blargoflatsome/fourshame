      ## General Flourish


      You want to do *something cool* to gain Advantage to your attack.


      `Skill Check. Base DC of 10.`


      The DM sets the DC and Skill based on what you are attempting.`Succeed: Gain Advantage on your attack roll.

      If the target drops to 0hp you may then roll to Intimidate to frighten all enemies within 10' of you.Fail: The attack action fails.Fumble: Suffer a negative effect as determined by the DM.`


      ## Disarm


      A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target’s grasp.


      `The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

      If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands.The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.`


      ## Subdue


      You may attempt to render any creature of CR/Lvl 3 or below Unconscious.\

      *Undead and Constructs are immune.*


      #### Choke Them Out


      * Step One:

        * `Grapple the target with both hands.`
      * Step Two:

        * `At the start of the Targets turn it must make a Constitution Save vs a DC of 10 + Your Strength modifier. They roll at Disadvantage if you have the Grappler Feet.`
        * `Success: They may act normally as if simply grappled.`
        * `Failure: They fall Unconscious for either 1d4 rounds, until they take damage, or receive any form of healing.`

      #### Punch Out


      * Step One:

        * `You must deal Bludgeoning Damage to the creature.`
      * Step Two:

        * `The target makes a Constitution Save vs a DC equal to the Bludgeoning Damage of a single attack.
          If the weapon adds other damage types only the Bludgeoning Damage counts toward the DC.
          If you have multiple attacks in a round the target rolls with Disadvantage on the subsequent hits.`
        * `Failure: They fall Unconscious for either 1d4 rounds, until they take damage, or receive any form of healing.`

      ## Coup De Gras


      Once an enemy is Unconscious or Asleep you may attempt to execute them if you have the logical means to do so.


      `Make a Stealth Check vs their Passive Perception.Success: The target is reduced to zero HP.Failure: The target wakes up. Roll for Initiative.`


      ## Hitting Cover


      When a ranged attack misses a target that has cover, you risk hitting the cover instead. First, determine whether the attack roll would have hit the protected target without the cover. If the attack roll falls within a range low enough to miss the target but high enough to strike the target if there had been no cover, the object used for cover is struck.


      If a creature is providing cover for the missed creature and the attack roll exceeds the AC of the covering creature, the covering creature is hit.


      ## Goading An Attack


      When you land an attack on a target you may make an Intimidation roll against the target's Passive Insight to cause the target to attack you on its next turn.

      ## Shove / Trip


      #### Standard Rules


      As an action you may make a special melee attack to shove a creature; either to knock it prone or to push it away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.


      `The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach.Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) checkYou succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated.If you succeed, you either knock the target prone (trip) or push (shove) it back 5 feet.`


      ## Shove To The Side


      Same as above but with Disadvantage.


      `Moves the target 5 feet to either side instead of back 5 feet`


      ## Shove Attack


      You may sacrifice your Movement Speed to Shove/Trip a target after a succesful hit as a Bonus Action.


      `You must declare your intent before the attack is made.You lose all of your movement regardless of success.On a Hit: The target suffers damage and the result of your Shove/Trip challenge.On a Miss: Your movement is reduced to zero.On a Critical Hit: Gain Advantage on the Shove/Trip challenge.Fumble: You are knocked prone in the attempt.`
    tabName: Shove Actions
  - body: >-
      ## Grapple


      You use 1 hand to grab hold of your target in some way.


      `Uses one Attack Action.Roll an Athletics check vs the targets Athletics or Acrobatics checkSuccess: Target's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.`


      #### While Grappling


      You may only move at half speed (taking your target with you) and use one handed attacks.\

      Grappling poses no further restrictions to attacks or spell casting.


      #### Escape A Grapple


      You have a few options...


      `Break Free: Use a full Action to Roll Athletics or Acrobatics vs the targets AthleticsShove them away: Cause an effect that would force the Grappler out of reach. Such as the Thunderwave spell, or a Shove/Trip action.Kill them.`


      #### Grappling With Both Hands


      Win two consecutive Grapple Checks against a single target without them breaking free.


      `Target becomes Restrained. This also prevents Somatic spell casting.You may only make unarmed strikes (headbut, or kicks) against the target. Body slams or similar attacks would be Unarmed Shove Attacks.`


      #### Manacles


      If you have Manacles you may 'handcuff' the target to keep them Restrained.


      `Roll your Grapple Checks at Disadvantage to apply the manacles.Escaping the Manacles: Roll a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.Break Free: Roll a DC 20 Strength check.Thieves Tools: DC 15 Dexterity check. Requires a proficiency with thieves' tools and a set of Thieve's tools.Cut the Manacles: Manacles have 15 hit points.`


      ## Tackle


      You may attempt to Tackle an opponent your size category or smaller.\

      Gain advantage if the target is two size categories smaller than you.


      `Move at least 10' in a straight line toward opponent then make an Unarmed Strike to knock them over.On a Hit: You are both knocked prone.On a Miss: You a prone. The target may now take an attack of opportunity against you as Reaction.`


      ## Climb Onto A Larger Creature


      #### If The Target Is Your Size Category Or One Step Larger


      Use a simple Grapple Check to climb on them.


      #### If The Creature Is Two Or More Size Categories Larger


      The smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature’s space and clings to its body.


      While in the target’s space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.


      The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature’s space, treating the space as difficult terrain.


      The larger creature’s ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature’s location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

    body: >-
      ## Cleaving Through Creatures


      When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points.


      > Red War Paint (Homebrew Item)

      >

      > A Cleave attack allows you to spread the damage of one attack across multiple adjacent enemies.

      >

      > Red War Paint grants you one free attack against any enemy within a 5' step per attack.

      >

      > Cleave is triggered when an enemy at full HP is reduced to 0Hp by a melee attack.

      >

      > Red War Paint is trigged anytime an enemy is reduced to 0Hp by a melee attack.

      ## Moving Through Hostile Creatures


      ### Standard Rules Movement Rules


      You can move through a non-hostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.


      ### Tumble


      You may tumble through a hostile creature's space without the risk of an Attack of Opportunity at the cost of half your Movement.


      Roll your Dexterity (acrobatics) vs the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics). If the tumbler wins you may bypass the creature and take the remaining half of your movement. This is mostly useful if a creature is blocking your way or if you have taken your actions and need to Disengage.


      If you Fail the target gets a free Attack on you without using their Reaction.


      ### Overrun


      You may attempt to muscle your way past an opponent without risking an Attack of Opportunity at the cost of half your movement. This functions the same as Tumble but with contested Strength (Athletics) checks.

      ## Mounted Combat


      In addition to the core rules for Mounts, we have added a 3rd more versatile option; the "Trained Mount"


      ### Training A Mount


      By Standard DnD rules a mount is either intelligent aka Uncontrolled or domesticated aka Controlled. Regardless, if you take the time to train with a mount it becomes a 'Trained Mount'.


      A Trained Mount is specific to the rider, and the benefits of that training do not apply to anyone but the person who trained it.


      Training a Mount is a Downtime Action. See the Downtime Rules for more information.


      Riding a 'Trained Mount' adds the following two benefits:


      #### Combat Control


      While riding a Trained Mount you may decide at the start of combat if the mount is Uncontrolled or Controlled. Furthermore, on your turn, you may use an Action to instruct the animal to switch modes. This requires an Animal Handling test with a DC determined by the DM. It will always be easier to transition a controlled mount to an uncontrolled mount than vice versa.


      #### Trained Attack


      While riding a Trained Mount you may optionally instruct the Controlled Mount to attack instead of making an attack action yourself. You may still perform any non-attack actions on your turn. Such as a Perception or Intimidation check.

      ### Favor Of The Crowd


      Only one fighter can have the Favor of the Crowd at a time. When Favor is earned it may be spent as described below but the crowds are fickle. Anytime a fighter does something to earn Favor they take it from whomever currently has it.


      #### Spend Favor


      * **Stabilize**  When you would drop to 0 hit points or fewer, you can spend the favor of the crowd to fight on. You drop to 1 hit point and remain on your feet.

      * **Critical Bonus Attack**  When you score a critical hit against a foe, if you already had the Favor of the Crowd, you can spend it to immediately make a single melee weapon attack against a foe (the same one you hit or another one) as a Bonus Action.

      * **Gain Advantage**  On your turn, you can spend the favor of the crowd to gain advantage on a single melee weapon attack.

      * **Excite the Crowd**  You may use the Favor of the Crowd to change the Attitude of the Crowd from Indifferent to Hostile or Hostile to Friendly.


      ### Sway The Crowd


      Party members not involved in the Combat may attempt to sway the Attitude of the Crowd in your favor by making a Charisma (Performance) check against a DC set by the crowd's current attitude toward you. They roll with Advantage if you have the Favor of the Crowd currently.


      * DC 20 to go from Indifferent to Friendly

      * DC 15 to go from Indifferent to Hostile

      * DC 10 to go from Hostile to Friendly


      ### Gain Favor


      Scoring a Critical Hit on an opponent dropping a foe to 0 hit points with an attack.


      Spend 1 Action to make a Charisma (Performance) check against a DC set by the crowd's attitude toward you.


      * DC 10 for Friendly: You are the people's champion.

      * DC 15 for Hostile: You are the heel and the people love to hate you.

      * DC 20 for Indifferent: You have bored the crowd and they do not care if you win or lose.


      ### Lose Favor


      * Opponent Claims Favor.

      * A Fumble.

      * The Attitude of the Crowd also changes to Indifferent.

      * You (or a party member rolling on your behalf) fails a Charisma (Performance) check.

**A Note on Battle Masters**
In my game, I have decided to favor interesting combat over supporting the Battle Master. Partially because I don't have a Battle Master in my game, but also because I don't feel any of these rules cheapen the Battle Master. The benefit of the Battle Master is that many of these maneuvers are easier or more effective because they specialize in them. There are also maneuvers available to the Battle Master that are not included here.
