      ## Alchemy Kit


      Alchemist's supplies include two glass beakers, a metal frame to hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and a pouch of common alchemical ingredients, including salt, powdered iron, and purified water.


      ### Learning On Your Own


      With this tool kit you can improve your rank through experimentation. During a long rest roll an Experimentation Roll (1d20 + Arcana vs DC 15) per your target Rank. On a failure you suffer 1d6 damage per your current Rank. Once you have succeeded in all rolls spend 1 renown.


      ### Rank 1


      **Arcana:** Proficiency with alchemist's supplies allows you to unlock more information on Arcana checks involving potions and similar materials.


      **Investigation**:  When you inspect an area for clues, proficiency with alchemist's supplies grants additional insight into any chemicals or other substances that might have been used in the area.

       **Easy Does It:**  You can attempt to improve one stat of your creation by making an Arcana roll DC 20. Failure causes the mixture to explode dealing 2d6 fire damage with other side effects possible at the DM's discretion. 

      ### Rank 2


      **Waste not want not:**  You now create 2 doses of any Rank 1 recipe when you craft it.


      **Seen a thing or two:**  You can reverse engineer an Alchemical mixture over a short rest. 


      ### Rank 3


      **Close Enough:**  You can replace 1 specific ingredient required by a Rank 2 or below recipe with another ingredient of your choice.


      **Arcana Paste:** You always have a bit of magic reactive paste on hand that glows when smeared on a magic item.


      ### Rank 4


      **Steady Hands:**  When you use "Easy Does It" on a Rank 3 or below mixture the DC is reduced to 10.

      Rank 5


      **Master Craftsman:** Double your Proficiency Modifier when using this tool|

## How Do I Make A Thing?

`1 recipe per long rest.`

## Learning Recipes

Some toolkits have specific recipe's for the items you can craft. You may pick 1 Recipe per rank in that craft.As you adventure you may discover more Recipes. There is no limit to how many Recipe's you may know, but you should track which ones you know on your sheet somewhere.

## Determine Item Quality (Optional)

`Quality Roll: 1d20 + Charisma Modifier + Proficiency Bonus`

The quality of the item created may effect its value, or how impressive it is to others, or even justify enhancing its function in some way.

| Quality Roll | Result                                                               |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 2-5          | **Poor.** Critics will openly mock this item and shops won't buy it. |
| 6-9          | **Fair.** Reduced market value.                                      |
| 10-15        | **Average.** What you would find in the source material.             |
| 16-20        | **Excellent.** Increased market value.                               |
| 21-30        | **Inspiring.** This item is sure to catch critical attention.        |

## How Do I Find Materials To Craft With?

`Scrounge Action (1d20 + Investigate Skill)`

#### Explained

Every craft has an associated generic “Material” that can be found when looting/scrounging around. Some items may require more or less “Material” to create and some may have additional ingredients that are more specific and potentially harder to find.\
To seek out the generic Materials by way of scrounging simply request to do so for a specific tool set. The DM will determine your success.

## How Do I Get Better At Making This Thing?

`Long Rest with a Toolkit Book or Teacher. This is all you may do during that long rest aside from rest.`

#### Explained

Each toolkit is rated on a scale of proficiency ranks from 1-5.\
To raise your rank you must either find a teacher with the rank you seek to possess\
or a Toolkit Book. When learning from books you must find a different book for each rank.\
You may only raise 1 rank per Long Rest.

## How Do I Learn A New Toolkit

`It takes 7 days of study with a teacher or a Toolkit Book to gain a new proficiency outside of those gained by your class.`
