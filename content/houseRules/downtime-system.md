This is a homebrew system to handle the extended periods of downtime between quests.

Downtime can be used to do two things. Perform Jobs or Train. Jobs work toward earning renown. Training spends renown.

## Renown Roll

`D20 + Charisma Mod vs DC 30`

During a downtime period, you can attempt to Roll for Renown. By default the DC for this roll is impossible. As you do Jobs the DC goes down. When the DC gets down to a level you think you can beat, you can ask to Roll for Renown. If you succeed your hard work is recognized and you gain 1 renown. If you fail the DC reverts to the default and you have to start over. This is the life of a commoner, not an adventurer, and it is the hardest and slowest way to gain renown.
