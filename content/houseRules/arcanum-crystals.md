      ## What Are They?


      Arcanum Crystals are a special crystal found in the Forgotten Valley. The danger in collecting the crystals has limited their study by educated Wizards but what is known from Tribal accounts are as follows.


      Arcanum Crystals absorb arcane energy when exposed to it and can re-channel that energy into other spell effects. The utility of an Arcanum Crystal is increased the larger it is. Sadly, the crystal is fragile and will break if over-exposed to arcane energy.


      ## How Do They Work?


      Arcanum Crystals have a max amount of Charges. There are three ways to charge a crystal, but care must be taken not to Over Charge a crystal of any size or it will fracture into smaller chunks dealing a moderate amount of damage based on its original size.


      #### Sorcery Points


      As sorcery can expend 1 sorcery point to return 1 charge back to an Arcanum Crystal. Spell Exposure


      Targeting an Arcanum Crystal directly with a spell will return 1 charge per spell level to the crystal.


      #### Storm Exposure


      Putting an Arcanum Crystal of any known size out in The Storm will fully recharge it after a short rest. This is the only method that poses no risk of Over Charge. The crystal will stop absorbing upon reaching its max.


      #### Over Charge


      A crystal can be given charges beyond its max but for every additional charge, it has a 10% chance of fracturing. So giving a Tiny crystal its 6th charge will have a 10% chance of fracturing white its 7th charge will have a 20% chance and so on.


      #### Benefits Of Overloading A Crystal


      A crystal will hold its charges until expended so overloading a crystal ahead of battle can improve the number of times it can be activated.


      When an Arcanum Crystal fractures it deals 1d10 Force Damage per Size Category to everything in a 10' diameter centered on the stone per Size Category. After the damage is dealt a Crystal of Small size or larger will leave behind 1d4 smaller shards. Each shard will be 1 size category smaller than the last, to a minimum size of tiny.


      So a Large Arcanum Crystal that fractures will deal 4d10 Force Damage in a 40' diameter and leave a max of 4 smaller shards \[Medium, Small, Tiny, Tiny], while a Small Arcanum Crystal will deal 2d10 Force Damage in a 20' diameter and leave a max of 4 tiny crystals behind.


      #### Concentration Spells


      If a spell cast by the Arcanum Crystal is a Concentration Spell it will consume the charges each round to remain in effect until you cancel the spell effect or the crystal runs out of charges. This spell does not count as your Concentration and can only be disrupted by damaging the Arcanum Crystal directly. Also, while maintaining a spell an Arcanum Crystal cannot be used to absorb Magic Damage. Attempting to do so will end the Concentration Spell immediately.

      ## Addiction Risk


      Use of Arcanum Crystals also carries a second set of risks. The Crystals were not meant for the Material Plane or the Mortal minds that attempt to wield them. The impact of this is heightened based on the size category and quantity of Arcanum Crystals in use.


      If you are attuned to the number of Arcanum Crystals as set by the size category and you use that Arcanum Crystal prior to a Long Rest (with the exception of the Large Arcanum Crystal) you must roll a percentile based on the size category that triggered the roll. If you roll under the percentile you suffer the effects as described.


      #### Frenzied Charge


      If one or more of your Arcanum Crystals is not at a max charge you must find a way to charge the crystal immediately or suffer 1 level of Exhaustion. Also, you must succeed at a Wisdom Save against a DC set by the size category in order to stop charging the crystal or until 1 crystal fractures.


      #### Arcane Madness


      You must make a Wis save against a DC set by the size category or gain a level of Madness as defined in the DMG. The base duration of the madness is set by the size category but if you are currently suffering from Madness already you will replace that Madness with one the next level up in duration. So if you are Attuned to 2 Small Arcanum Crystals and roll under the Percentile for both, and then fail the Wisdom Save for both, you will receive 1 Long Term Madness instead of 2 short terms. This does mean that you could end up with an Indefinite Madness if you are not careful. You may roll on the tables presented in the DMG or work with your DM to find something that works for your character. Subsequent Arcane Madness rolls the following day will stack with any current Madness you are suffering.


      | Size   | Quantity | When To Roll | Percentile | Effect                                                     |

      | ------ | -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

      | Tiny   | 2        | Long Rest    | 20%        | Frenzied Charge DC 10                                      |

      | Small  | 1        | Long Rest    | 30%        | Frenzied Charge DC 15. Arcane Madness DC 10 vs Short Term. |

      | Medium | 1        | Long Rest    | 40%        | Frenzied Charge DC 20. Arcane Madness DC 15 vs Long Term.  |

      | Large  | 1        | When Used    | 15%        | Arcane Madness DC 20 vs Long Term.                         |

      ## Arcanum Crystal Powers


      ### Tiny


      5 Charges


      To attune to an Arcanum Crystal you must hold it in your hand over a short rest while in a meditative trance without interruption. During this trance, you will unlock a secret latent power within the crystal. You will select one cantrip from the Sorcery spell list to represent this power. Once attuned this crystal is permanently set to the casting of this cantrip even if someone else attunes to it. The Cantrip can now be cast at the cost of 1 charge per casting as a Bonus Action.


      #### Attune Benefit


      Spell Absorption: Absorb 1d6 Magic Damage and regains 1 charge per 10 damage so absorbed as a Reaction.


      ### Small


      8 Charges


      To attune to an Arcanum Crystal you must hold it in your hand over a short rest while in a meditative trance without interruption. During this trance, you will unlock a secret latent power within the crystal. You will select one cantrip, one level 1 spelll from the Sorcery spell list to represent this power. Once attuned this crystal is permanently set to the casting of these spells even if someone else attunes to it. The Cantrip can now be cast at the cost of 1 charge per casting as a Bonus Action. The level 1 spell costs 2 charges as an Action.


      #### Attune Benefit


      Spell Absorption: Absorb 2d6 Magic Damage and regains 1 charge per 10 damage so absorbed as a Reaction.


      ### Medium


      12 Charges


      To attune to an Arcanum Crystal you must hold it in your hand over a short rest while in a meditative trance without interruption. During this trance, you will unlock a secret latent power within the crystal. You will select one cantrip, one level 1 spell, and one level 2 spell from the Sorcery spell list to represent this power. Once attuned this crystal is permanently set to the casting of these spells even if someone else attunes to it.


      The Cantrip can now be cast at the cost of 1 charge per casting as a Bonus Action. The level 1 spell costs 2 charges as an Action. The level 2 spell costs 3 charges as an Action.


      #### Attune Benefit


      Arcane Healing: At the cost of 2 Charges you may heal 1d4 +2 damage but the healing pulls in material from around you. So the more you use this feature the more of your body will be replaced by patches of stone, plant matter, or even the fur/skins of other humanoids/creatures. Resulting in a potentially frightful appearance over time. This effect can be reversed by removing the foreign material and relying on traditional means of re-healing the wound. Short of that any further side effects should be discussed with your DM.


      ### Large


      16 Charges


      Large Arcanum Crystals cannot be attuned to but are instead used to power special Arcanum Machines
  - tabName: Machines
    body: >-
      ## Arcanum Machines


      The Large Arcanum Crystal can fuel the machine for 1 day per charge. The machine may be further infused with the ability to cast 1 spell of the Evocation School from the Sorcerer Spell Table of level 3 or below. If you are a spell caster, you may instead infuse the machine with any spell (that makes sense) of level 3 or below from your own spell table (such as Pass Without Trace). Concentration spells will remain in effect for their duration but require additional charges to re-cast after the duration has ended.


      Each use of the spell costs as many Charges as the level of the spell. Once the spell has been set it may never be changed. To cause the machine to cast the spell you must be in physical contact with it, however, you can instead choose an activation word at the cost of a spell level. Meaning a word-activated spell must be of level 2 or below.


      ### Activating/Deactivating


      You must be in physical contact with the machine to Activate or Deactivate it. While the machine can run for multiple days on a single charge, it requires 1 charge to start every time. So should you de-activate the machine prematurely for any reason it will still cost you a second charge to boot it back up again. Activating a machine is an Action but Deactivating it is a free action.


      ### Special Addiction Rule


      Any time you activate your machine you must roll against the Addiction table.


      ### Vehicle Attunement Slots


      To increase the power of your machine it may hold up to 3 additional Arcanum Crystals of Medium size or smaller. These crystals work the same as if attuned to you but you must be in physical contact with the machine to utilize them.


      ### Machine Appearance


      This is largely up to you and your DM to find something that works and suits the intended purpose of the machine.


      ## Machine Stats


      ### Ability Scores


      Roll for Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma as you would a Character. Machines typically have no Intelligence or Wisdom.


      * **Size:** Medium + 1 size category per additional Arcanum Crystal attuned to a max of Huge.

      * **AC:** 15 + Dex Mod

      * **HP:** 10 * Constitution Mod

      * **Speed:** 30 * (Dex Mod - Half Con Mod) to a min of 30

      * **Damage Threshold:** 1d6 + Constitution Mod. Any hit that does not meet or exceed the DT of a vehicle is ignored.

      * **Mishap Threshold:** 1d6 + Constitution Mod x2. If the Machine takes equal or greater damage than its mishap threshold it must roll on the Mishaps table from "Infernal War Machines"


      ### Actions


      A machine has no actions of its own and must be operated by someone in physical contact with the machine. Only one creature can drive the machine at the Helm to control the movement of the machine but each additionally attuned Arcanum Stone may be controlled by a separate creature if the Machine has a separate station for them.


      ### Driver Bonus Actions


      The driver may take the Dash of Disengage actions as Bonus Actions Repair Machine


      A machine may heal 2d4 +2 damage for 1 charge of any Arcanum Crystal attuned to it. The healing pulls in materials from the surrounding areas to patchwork the issue. Alternatively, if you are proficient in Tinkerers Tools you may roll a DC 15 Dexterity Check + Proficiency Bonus to manually repair 4d4 +4 damage over the course of a short rest. The machine must be Deactivated to repair it manually.


      ### Crashing


      When a Machine crashes into something it takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (Max 20d6). Whatever the machine struck takes the same damage. Any creature on or within the machine must also make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take the same damage or half as much on a successful save.


      ### Crashing Into Creatures


      The Machine can be driven into another creature's space. The creature may use a Reaction to attempt to get out of the way with a DC 10 Dexterity Save. If the creature is unable to get out of the way it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn. (Max 20d6)


      If the Machine is at least two size categories larger than the creature it hit it can continue to move through the creature's space if it has any movement left. Otherwise, the Machine comes to a sudden stop and each creature inside the Machine must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or half as much damage.
