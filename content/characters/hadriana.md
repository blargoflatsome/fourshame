Elvenwood Ravensight of Wolf Grove and Myst Pren of Mothers Grove

**Grandaughter of**\
Elder Melyn Pren of Mother’s Grove

**Backstory**

When the daughter of Melyn Pren decided to marry a lowly fisherman from Wolf Grove it caught the forest by surprise. It was a massive honor to all of Wolf Grove, but before the Ancient Elder would bless the union he demanded that Elvenwood prove himself in a match of Skull Ball. The fisherman had never had the honor of playing the game before once again he shocked everyone by picking up the game with ease. When others would tire he would barely break a sweat. It has been many years since those days and age has weakened him some but still, he wakes with the sun and tends to the fish of Nashoba lake assuring plenty of food for all of Wolf Grove.

They say that for some murder is the only door through which they enter life. Your birth claimed the life of your mother. The Druids disagreed as to the meaning of it. Some say that your infant form demanded more than others, that you consumed the life force of your mother and would be all the stronger for her sacrifice. Others warned that it was a punishment for her marriage outside of the ancient families of the forest. Whatever Melyn Pren felt of it you do not know, you have never been to Mother’s Grove nor has your extended family ever shown an interest in your life. You were raised by your father and because of his love and devotion to you and all of Wolf Grove you were accepted by Wolf Grove and many still regard you as a great honor and a legacy that binds your Grove to that of the great Mother’s Grove - home of the Spirit Mother. On account of this, you are used to a certain level of leeway within the Grove and special treatment. Elder Prescilla Oakborn has never shied away from explaining your birth as a miracle for it was her own hands that guided you out of your late mother and into life.

Everyone believed you would become a powerful druid - maybe even become the Elder of your own grove someday - but try as you might you have never been able to harness the divine power of nature. Not once has a seed under your care taken root. In your darkest hours, you may have felt that you were filled with death itself or perhaps cursed for the life you took in your birth.

In time your father removed you from druidic training and instead trained you to take over the lake, taught you to fish, to manage the boats and the nets. Not a job suitable for a Pren, but you found joy in it and the time you shared with your father.

It was while fishing with your father that you first learned of your other gifts. Near the edge of the lake opposite of your Grove, a small group of Goblins were using spears and some kind of explosives for fishing in the shallow waters. Your father was furious and still quite strong back then, so he docked the boat a safe distance away and told you to stay behind while he searched for a way to stop the goblins.

You waited until you heard him yell just before the explosion. You ran upon the scene finding your father in a heap on the ground. All around him was charred black, he had attempted to detonate all the goblin's unused explosives but must not have been able to get out of the blast radius. The goblins were circling him and in your panic, you reached for him only to release a dense and foul smoke from your quivering hand that washed over the goblins and to your horror your father as well.

By the grace of the Spirit Mother your father survived the poison where the goblins could not, but his body was never as strong and a cough has plagued him in the years since. Neither of you told anyone about the incident but once he recovered your father told you of a hermit living in the forest to the south. The only way to get there would be to sneak out and brave the black alone or find a way to get a group together to go with you. You were too young then but you are old enough now and in private you have trained yourself to control the powers that seem innate to you but without a teacher you can’t hope to learn your true potential. The hermit, your father says, can instruct you in the arcane arts.
