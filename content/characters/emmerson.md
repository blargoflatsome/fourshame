Originally born in Wolf Grove; Emmerson trained as barbarian under Gerald Stumpton, before being sent to Mother's Grove. There, he continued his training as a fighter with a special focus on the protection of others. 

The forest is safest where it's lit by the Mother's violescent plants, but the druids and healers often have to brave the territory near the borders or even venture beyond them into The Black. Emmerson, and those trained along a side him, were trained to escort and protect them.

Using what he learned from Gerald, in combination with the training he received in Mother's Grove, Emmerson did remarkably well. Gaining great renown and recognition not only for his prowess as a fighter but also for his dedication and determination to protect his charge.

It is because of that, that Eunice Oakborn of Wolf Grove requested Emmerson be given Remi as a charge.
