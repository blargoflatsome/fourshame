Killian Gren was first encountered when captured by Gerald Stumpton, he was to be executed after questioning due to being an outsider sneaking about in the forest. Upon learning that his sister had been captured by the grung, the party convinced the Elder to spare him. They also reasoned that he may be of help in their battle against Grim Gash and the orcs.

The party rescued Killian's sister Chloe, and with Killian's help, they managed to leave the forest to seek out the Bronze City. Home of the orcs.

Killian has been a valuable ally ever since, even learning (and keeping) the secret of Hadriana's bloodline and that Fetek remains under castle Tor. 

Chloe on the other hand has had little to do with the party since her rescue and still cautions her brother to be careful around them.
