Discovered by Precilla Oakborn within the forest on Mother's Day, Thaishin was a miracle. He displayed the apparent characteristics of an Irishne elf, the long-extinct people of Myrcella Roudgara 

He was an omen of the good that is to come, chosen by the Mother to be raised and trained to defeat Torquill Von Demillo himself.

The only problem? Thaishin lived in daily fear of his chosen path. Even to the point of taking suicidal risks just to tempt his own fate.

At the gates of Tor it was revealed that Thaishin was, in fact, an Infernal, but before anyone could ask too many questions he was sent away by the Mother to pursue 'other interests'.

Recently he resurfaced in Pyre Grove, where the Mother has hoped to have him lead the party into Ravished to take on Torquill. The party refused, and Thaishin is said to have gone on ahead. Alone.

While his ultimate fate is still unknown, it has been revealed that in the time between Tor and Pyre Grove he remained in the Forbidden Valley. Muspella had prayed to the Spirit Mother over a mass grave just outside of Tor, in response a tree sprouted and grew from within the grave. The site of that tree is now Amnesty Grove and is dedicated to the Spirit Mother. It was Thaishin who oversaw its creation.
