Discovered by Precilla Oakborn within the forest on Mother's Day, Thaishin was a miracle. He displayed the apparent characteristics of an Irishne elf, the long extinct people of Myrcella Roudgara 

He was an omen of the good that is to come, chosen by the Mother to be raised and trained to defeat Torquill Von Demillo himself.

The only problem? Thaishin lived in daily fear of his chosen path. Even to the point of taking suicidal risks just to tempt his own fate.
