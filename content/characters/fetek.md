> "T﻿he Blood of Fetek Bows To None" - Fetek

F﻿etek never served Uralom as the other dragons had, nor did he arrive on the continent with Uralom. He arrived after and took Tor by surprise in the year 20BE. He also has the honor of being the only one in known history to defeat Torquill Von Demillo.

U﻿ralom gave Fetek a legion of infernals to command upon his success but Fetek soon learned to create his own. Only those of his blood could ever truly be trusted. 

Fetek was a private creature so history knows little about his motivations but what we do know is that he was content in Tor for 5 years. In the year 15BE Orom the silver took Helles Lichet as his own. It was at this time that Orom revealed his own legion of mutations known as the angelics. Many speculate that Fetek and Orom must have had a history together elsewhere because later that same year Fetek made another surprise move, ignoring the growing threat to his south in Ferenia, Fetek left Tor and marched upon Helles Lichet.

T﻿he angelics proved their mettle against his legions, and it was during this battle that the now legendary Bronze Orc was revealed to be a bronze dragon after all. The combined might of the bronze horde and Orom was too much for Fetek. By mid 14BE Fetek was back in Tor, licking his wounds. 

H﻿istory would tell us it was that show of weakness that caused Uralom to come down from the charred mountains and claim Tor from Fetek. That he killed him and claimed what remained of his legions. History is wrong.

T﻿he Keeper's of the Dark know that the body of Fetek was never found, but even they are wrong. The very much alive body of Fetek was found by Hadriana. Deep below castle Fetek, bound in chains even an ancient dragon cannot break. Speaking to whispers in the dark, still refusing to bow.

W﻿e do not know why Uralom merely bound Fetek, but what we do know is that in the final battle it was Fetek that helped a small group of humanoids escape. Taking with them a book of research done by Eskar Banay on the topic of creating infernals. It was Fetek's will that they would create a blood pit in secret and return with a legion to break his bonds and set him free. The last and therefore most powerful dragon.

T﻿his group parted ways when they fell upon the bronze horde, all those not taken captive by the orcs fled further south. To Roudgara forest, though it had a different name then. Those taken captive would one day break free and form the barbaric blood cult known as the Uruk. Those that went south would discover the Spirit Mother and become the Pren.
