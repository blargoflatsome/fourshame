---
A﻿ member of the Shadowmen that managed to purify himself of the darkweed thanks to the assistance of Purity and the boyhood familiarity of Hadriana. Now a member of the party with a troubling and mysterious past.

There are several noticeable piercings on Dante’s face, the first of which are two small silver studs just to the side of his left eye, which are colloquially known as “crow's feet” piercings. A similar set of studs can also be found elsewhere, only this time, on his tongue – a venom piercing. His nose also has a piercing in the form of a small silver ring that resides in and around his right nostril. The intricate piercings then start to emerge when you focus on Dante’s ears. His ears are covered in litter trinkets that encompass the entirety of his Darwin’s Tubercle, as well as his actual lobule. Everything from a miniature skull to a leathery wing can be seen on his set of ears.

Like the piercings, Dante also has a plethora of tattoos on his body. Both of his hands and parts of his forearms are covered in black in. About two inches above the wrist, the black canvas starts to fade away, showing some un-tattooed segments of skin. This is essentially stylized into what can only be described as petrified trees that sprawl up the rest of his forearm and end in-and-around the elbow area. Written in a foreign language around the circumference of his neck are letters that read “Αμβο ιν ελιγενδο, υτρυμϙυε περδισ” which translates to “In choosing both, you lose both”. Above and below his right eye are two filled-in triangular-shaped black tattoos, that are akin to those you would see on a clown’s face. Finally, Dante's largest tattoo spans from just above his pelvis, round and up onto his neck. This tattoo takes the shape of a large centipede, and like the rest of them, is black in coloration.
