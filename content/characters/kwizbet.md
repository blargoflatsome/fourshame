Kwizbet is a mysterious old hermit found early in the campaign. An old friend of Hadriana's parents, and an outsider living secretly within the forest. He has known the secret of the Pren bloodline all these years and kept it, he also served Corruption whom he claims helped him earn his right to stay within the forest.

Hadriana was sent to find him so that he may help her learn to control her power, and the old man has watched over and aided her and her party without really asking for anything in return. Even assisting them in purifying Corruption, and helping them navigate the outside world when they first went to Keeper's March.

After an encounter with a tattoo artist named Thor, living among a group of grafters, Kwizbet and Thor unlocked a method of enchanting the flesh with arcane tattoos. It is one of his matching tattoos that allows Hadriana and Remi to see each other across realms and invisibility.
