---
W﻿hen the minotaur city of Knossos was first pulled up from the underdark by the wild magic storm of the Forgotten Valley, it was Tiat Honorskull who saved his people.

I﻿t was Tiat Honorskull who first met with the Centaur and learned "The Way of Peace" which allowed him and his people to overcome the ancient curse of Blood Rage that had long kept his people at war, but would only have ensured their doom within the storm.

I﻿t was Tiat Honorskull who put down the rebellion of Uat Bonesplitter, who resisted "The Way of Peace", and struck his house name from history. 

I﻿t was Tiat Honorskull who honored and released the three Dwarven slaves that survived the surfacing. Ruby Bloodstone, Nickell Loadstone, and Gerald Stumpton.

D﻿espite being the first king; Tiat would personally explore the surface world to learn and forge a place for his people. With him, Tiat would bring Gerald Stumpton who would become his closes friend and confidant. Some would say the dwarf became overly familiar with the King and often spoke out of turn.

U﻿nrest was a constant foe in those formative years as the minotaur struggled against their curse but it was another dwarf, clouded by the past, that would bring the rein of Tiat to an end. 

Ruby Bloodstone could not forgive the past and in an act of revenge, she killed Tiat's wife and children. While she accepted and even welcomed her fate; when the punishment of execution was decreed another dwarf named Nickell Loadstone rushed to stop it and save her. In the struggle, he was fatally wounded and died.

G﻿erald, in his grief, demanded the King see reason and seek the peaceful path. To accept the blood of Nickell and merely banish Ruby from Knossos forever. Tiat, it's said, wept for his friend who would be alone in this world if he took the life of the last surviving dwarf but he roared for his family and in his grief banished them both.

I﻿n the aftermath Tiat Honorskull, having lost his family and closest friend, lost his appetite for power. He selected a successor,  Kuvrack Bloodfist, and then departed Knossos as well.

H﻿e would later be found by the party working as a blacksmith in Keeper's March. Muspella, the adopted daughter of Gerald Stumpton, convinced Tiat to return with them to Roudgara Forest in order to repair his relationship with Gerald. 

H﻿owever, before that would come to pass Gerald was taken by Betrayal and Muspella was fed to the Den Mother's blood pit. So Tiat went off alone to face his former friend; only to die at his hand.

A﻿s Tiat was not of the forest, the reapers felt the call to his passing. His soul remains and has not been reaped, should the party locate it the old minotaur may finally in death know true peace.
