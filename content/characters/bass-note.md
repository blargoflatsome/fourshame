The Tarsy were a native species to the Whispering Woods long before the Blight Sisters enacted their profane rituals. They were peaceful, kind, and in tune with the natural world. They were favorites of Purity in particular.

After the Sundering, the Tarsy felt the shift in nature almost immediately. They could feel it in their bones and hear it in their music. Many believed the world was ending, and the anxiety and panic induced in these soft-hearted creatures broke Purity's heart.

So when she found a cure, how could she not use it? As Corruption, the blight sister profaned the Tarsy just as her father had done to her. Turning them all into goblins.

Thanks to the efforts of our heroes, however, the curses of Corruption have all ended and the Tarsy have returned to their natural state. It has been hundreds of years though, and none of the original Tarsy remain... all these Tarsy have ever known is how to be goblins. It will be up to Purity to show them the way back to being what they once were.

Here, enters Bass Note. A bard of some renown as a goblin, he now finds himself navigating this strange new world (and body) as a Tarsy. He no longer feels the carnal lust for violence that came with being a goblin, but actually seems to enjoy being *helpful.*

Purity has recognized this in him, as well as his eagerness to travel. An eagerness that sets him apart from the other Tarsy, but if anything can be said about Bass Note it's that he marches to his own drum. 

While not a permanent member of the party, Purity has sent him to aid them from time to time along their journeys.
