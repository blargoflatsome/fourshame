Mirriam belongs to a prestigious dwarven family known primarily for founding an order known as the Canaries. They are renowned fighters that hunt the deepest depths of the veiled mountains. They are the first line of defense against the creatures of the deep that could threaten their work as well as their homes.

H﻿aving proven herself in the depths, Mirriam was Glitter Glavendrops first choice to marry her son; Deklan. It was the hope of the Glavendrop family that her hearty nature would produce an offspring capable of surviving a terrible genetic disease that had been taking the lives of their young for the past 3 years. Tragically, this would not come to be and their child passed away within the first year.

T﻿he loss put a strain on her marriage and her work. So when the Gladstone family arrived seeking Glitter's support on a risky trade deal with an up-and-coming leader within the neighboring Roudgara Forest, Glitter quickly saw an opportunity. Glitter had learned that the forest housed a healer of some repute, and having exhausted all common medical knowledge, insisted that the healer come to her home. Then she pulled Mirriam out of the mines so that she could personally ensure these outsiders safety. 

M﻿irriam accepted in the hopes that she may yet learn what took the life of her child.
