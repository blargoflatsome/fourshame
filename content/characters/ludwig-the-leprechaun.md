Ludwig is actually a spriggan, but he introduced himself as a leprechaun in the hopes that it would go over better. He believes that the Blight Sisters were made profane around the same time that the gates to the feywild closed, and hopes the two are related.

It was Ludwig that enlisted the party to purify the Blight Sisters, and lucky he did because it was Hadriana and Remi that saved him from Betrayal. Sadly, they couldn't save his changeling daughter but they did save his son. Who turned out to be Edward Scornborn.

Since the return of Purity, Ludwig has taken on the role of her protector.
