## History 

After the sundering, when the Old Gods abandoned the Druids of what is now the Roudgara Forest, diseased swept across the Forest.

 The Druids did everything they could to fight back against the plague but without the guidance and power of their gods, they were helpless to cure it.

In their efforts to appeal to their god's mercy they went on a war path capturing anything they could that may upset the balance and beauty of nature. Turning to the ritual sacrifice of their enemies before ultimately sacrificing what few of them remained in an act of mass suicide. It was these final druids' hope that the cause of all their misery was in fact themselves and that with their death the gods would restore the balance for future generations. 

The mortal druids were not alone in this time of panic and fear. Dryads, Satyr, and other Fae who had chosen to live, or trapped, on the material plane were not immune to the devastation or the fear.  

So desperate had some become that they wished for any god or indeed any being of power to hear and help them. To this end, a Satyr named Tut had grown quite desperate. He was a messenger of the old god, the Forest Father, and knew better than most the cold absence of his lord. 

Tut was near death when he pleaded to primal forces for a cure, any cure. Perhaps his prayers were finally answered or fever had merely driven him mad but Tut became convinced that through three separate acts of profanity he could save his three dryad daughters. Who he had named Purity, Kindness, and Joy. 

To Purity he sacrificed the dryad's most loved unicorn, painting her tree in its blood and planting the horn in her roots. Purity was furious when she saw what had been done but Tut bid her drink of the blood and eat of its flesh. Though her tears salted the meat before each bite, she did as she was told. To her horror, the deed had worked and she grew stronger... and with the final drop of blood, Purity became Corruption. 

Her tree is now forever marred in gore, her roots hunger for flesh. Yet, of the illness, she was cured. She quickly forgot all objections and bid her sisters to eat and drink as she had. Though they agreed, they were not cured nor could they hold down the meat. Tut knew now that his profane deeds needed to continue, and it was Corruption who told him of her sister Joy's mortal lover. 

Tut bid the mortal to his daughter's tree and swore that he would permit their love if only he would demonstrate its depth by enduring any hardship the Satyr may request of him. The mortal, blind with love, agreed. 

To Joy's tree, he nailed her mortal lover by the wrists and feet. Joy could only watch his agony and feel him die and then rot. As the light faded from his eyes, their hearts broke as one. Only when all of her tears had rained down did the illness abate. Desiccated, dry, and withered to the bone Joy became Misery. As her tree began to rot from the inside it split down the middle and took her lover's corpse in where carrion beasts picked his bones clean. The bark of her tree fractured and split forming spikes all around it to ward any other from drawing near. So too was she cured of her illness. Corruption and Misery conspired that night with Tut to cure their sister, Kindness. 

Daily Kindness visited the local druids to ease their suffering as best she could. Daily her heart broke. 

Misery could hear the cries of a druid near death in the forest. Corruption could smell the disease on him. Tut brought Kindness to the woman. Corruption told her that if she would only drink the sick woman's blood, her own illness would heal. Misery told her it was true, but the woman would have to be awake and aware. Kindness refused at first but Tut swore to her that when they were cured they would have the power to save the rest. 

Kindness was known to the woman and she welcomed her to sit and ease her pain. Kindness did so but rather than sing her sweet songs she pinned the woman down and rooted herself in her blood. While the blood eased her own suffering, the woman fought and screamed out against her. Pleading and crying. Whimpering and eventually dying. As the woman fell limp Kindness became Betrayal. Her tree twisted and split into two with a shared trunk. Betrayal herself now has two mouths. One that sweetly sings her prey to sleep and one that lies. Yet, of the illness, she was cured.

As for Tut, he had one last profane act to do. To himself, he sacrificed the followers of his old god. For it was Tut that convinced the druids to ritual sacrifice. Tut, a Satyr like any other, lost all love for revelry. All ability for song. Of the illness, he was cured but little remained worth living for. So he wept.

Tut wept for his daughters. Wept for his followers. More than any, he wept for himself. To his horror, Tut could not die by his own hand. Nor could he leave the cavern temple where the bodies of his followers lay in heaps. Tut had become Regret.

## Corruption / Purity

Corruption plagued the party early on, even turning one of their own against them as she corrupted and controlled the flesh of Issaterra. She did not wage war against her sisters, but often played the two against each other. 

The party enacted a ritual that purified the dryad and she is once more Purity. Her territory is now a safe haven for the party, and for fey. Though she has taken no direct action against her sisters, she supports the party's efforts to purify them as well.

## Misery / Joy

It has been revealed to the party that Misery, and her sisters, manipulated Myrcella Roudgara and upon the elve's death she bound her soul to Misery's tree. A divine soul and the arcane spirit of a fey joined as one, they became the Spirit Mother. Driven by Myrcella's vengeance and feeding on pain.

According to Ludwig an act of pure love must be performed before the tree of Misery in order to purify her.

## Betrayal / Kindness

Betrayal wages a war in the shadows against The Spirit Mother under the name "Lady of Thorns". For years her 'Shadowmen' were nothing more than the boogie man. A horror story to keep children from wandering too far from the light of the Mother's violescent plants. 

In the past year, plots came to fruition, and advantages were taken. The Shadowmen have been revealed to be all too real. Druids that had been twisted by the dark violescent of Betrayal. A plant that seeds itself in the heart of its host and poisons the mind. 

The party knows that in order to purify Betrayal, "All secrets must be revealed" before her tree. They just don't know exactly whose secrets.
