Varra Shadowpath: 20 yrs old, 5'9, the sister in an identical set of twins with her brother Darra. Lightly tanned skin a shade darker than her brother's due to being outside in the sun more with her passion, the animals of the forest; Long jet black dreads with various leaves and animal bones are woven in.  Light purple eyes and charcoal makeup

Darra Shadowpath: nearly the same in all ways to Varra except for his skin is lighter due to being inside more with his passion, tinkering, and inventing, and his eyes are a light teal. 

Both siblings' eyes are light enough and they maintain their appearance to be similar to each other so they can test switching with each other in various situations. Usually, a harmless prank to push what they can get away with. Their parents often ate dinner with Hadriana before she was born and then became her companions along with Issaterra for a time before growing apart from her when they left to take up druidic studies. Their father Ishnuh and their mother Levith have continued to keep tabs on and give companionship to my father to this day. 

Currently, Varra is caring for Hadriana's father and Darra has become her bee keeper.
