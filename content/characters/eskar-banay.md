---
E﻿skar Banay is, or perhaps was, a Rakshasa. However, when he died his soul had nowhere to go. The Hell of the outer planes cannot be accessed from this world. So he has jumped from body to body in a desperate attempt to hold off the entropic forces of the Fade and to avoid the attention of Reapers.

U﻿ltimately, he seeks a way to construct a body that can house his soul permanently. To regain the immortality he was accustomed too.

To that end he pursued Remi in an effort to either trick or force, her to aid him. Believing she held the secrets to unlocking what he was missing in his own research.

M﻿ost recently he claimed the body of a vampire, but in a battle with Remi he was stabbed by a cursed dagger provided by Purity. The dagger petrified the flesh of his body and seemingly trapped Escar's soul within.
