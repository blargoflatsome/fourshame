D﻿uncan Crane fled into the forest at the tail end of the Time of Atrocities. He felt beckoned by the woods and it was a good thing too, as Torquill betrayed and slaughtered the necromancers that had helped him win the war.

H﻿e then created Crane Tower within Corruptions territory and performed research for her; often corresponding with Kwizbet on their projects.

E﻿skar Banay over powered Duncan Crane, in order to gain access to the research he had performed while serving Torquill. Research that was built upon his own work from back in Tor. Remi, and her friends, found Eskar and uncovered his ruse. Setting the real Duncan Crane free, and forcing Eskar to once again flee.

D﻿uncan repayed the favor by aiding the party in infiltrating Corruptions territory.
