I﻿ssatera was the first, and perhaps the last, gnome to take the druids path within the groves. Her life of adventure was, however, cut short by the blight sisters. 

Corruption gifted Issatera her necklace, and from the bond she was slowly able to corrupt her flesh and mind. Eventually turning her against her own party. The ensuing battle nearly killed her, but she was saved by a mysterious dark fey named Farlan. 

W﻿hatever happened to her after that is a mystery but what is known is that during the Grim Wars her soul-bonded tree was destroyed by the dark weed of Betrayal. As her tree died, so too did she. Wherever she was.

A﻿n excerpt from her final scene:

> The tension in the room is thick and palpable. Issaterra is making her way to the door, wondering about the future and where to go from here but needing to just be anywhere else. Hadriana moves to go with her while Killian looks to Bulgar with pleading eyes. The minotaur merely observes the room. 
>
> Y﻿et, as Hadriana nears Issa she can feel it for the first time. It starts with the hairs on the back her neck and then a chill down her spine. Even her wings twitch. This must be what the Druids have been talking about. Warning about. This is what drives the mothers fury, the dry heat that denies her throat its quenching vengeance. This is the Evil. 
>
> Chairs screech against the floor behind you, swords are drawn only to clang uselessly against the floor. The 5 keepers who reside in the fort can be heard in the distance choking and gasping for breath, clutching at their throats. 
>
>  A juicy half eaten apple drops from issatera's hand. Rotten and Thick with maggots. 
>
> Her cheery laughter and innocent demeanor sloughs off her shoulders like a heavy costume after a long days rehearsal. Muspella's grief instinctively takes a back seat to her ever gnawing rage as the raspy cackle begins at the base of Issatera's throat. Turning to meet Hadriana's widening eyes the acorn necklace dangling from her throat pulses like the heartbeat she no longer possesses. 
>
> With sunken cheeks and hallow eyes she speaks "If squabbling children are the best my dear sister Misery has to offer, lets end this charade once and for all!"
