I﻿ssatera was the first, and perhaps the last, gnome to take the druids path within the groves. Her life of adventure was, however, cut short by the blight sisters. 

Corruption gifted Issatera her necklace, and from the bond she was slowly able to corrupt her flesh and mind. Eventually turning her against her own party. The ensuing battle nearly killed her, but she was saved by a mysterious dark fey named Farlan. 

W﻿hatever happened to her after that is a mystery but what is known is that during the Grim Wars her soul-bonded tree was destroyed by the dark weed of Betrayal. As her tree died, so too did she. Wherever she was.
