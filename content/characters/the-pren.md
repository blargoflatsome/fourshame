T﻿he Pren are the founding family of Roudgara Forest. Survivors of the final battle of the Dragon Wars in Tor, and carry the blood of Fetek in their veins.

T﻿he family tree of the Pren is complex. To start, the original Pren was not all blood-related. The word Pren meant food in Tor, but they took it as a surname and wrapped it up in their pride to change its meaning forever.  As they learned the ways of the druid, some achieved the gifts to slow their aging to a near crawl. This meant that some took many wives and husbands over the years, and bore many children over time.

M﻿elyn Pren, Grand Elder of Roudgara Forest, was one of those timeless Pren. He also set the tone for the family as  a whole. He was a deeply prideful and secretive man.

H﻿e had three daughters important to this campaign. Saphire, Lila, and Myst. Of them, Myst was the only to show overt signs of the family's biggest secret, the curse of the foul blood, or as it has been revealed in Hadriana; Dragon's blood.

M﻿yst, against her father's wishes, married a fishermen from Wolf Grove by the name of Elvenwood Ravensight. He had to first prove himself in skull ball, which he did much to the shock of everyone. Sadly, Myst died in child-birth so Hadriana was raised as a fishermen's daughter. Not as a Pren.

S﻿aphire Pren is the Ovate of Mother's Grove, and has not come up much in our story so far. Though that may change soon. She also has a daughter, Indred Pren. Indred is a mere 13 years of age, and was saved from a Den Mother attack by Hadriana and her party.

L﻿ila Pren proved herself on the hunting grounds and became a renowned warrior. Taking her skills to the front line she trains the warriors of Pyre Grove to defend the forest from the undead and the Ravished burning festival.

F﻿letch Pren is a cousin and served as the second to Melyn Pren. He was kinder than Melyn and many preferred to speak to him and allow him to speak their message to Melyn.
