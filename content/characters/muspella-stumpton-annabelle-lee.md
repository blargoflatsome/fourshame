Found as a baby by Gerald Stumpton, Muspella was raised in the ways of the Barbarian. 

While Gerald, and many in the forest, believed her unusual features were a blessing of the forest, Muspella had a darkness within her that made her rage especially raw. Her training was often less about learning to express her rage, but to harness and direct it productively.

It wasn't until her naming day when Muspella joined Hadriana, Issatera, and Thaishin in a Vision Quest that the truth of her heritage began to reveal itself.

In truth, Muspella was a Profane birth. The result of her parent's combined evil. So is it any wonder that in her chaotic pursuit of righteousness among the vengeance-focused teachings of the forest that she quickly earned the nickname "slave killer"?

Gerald found a ring within her basket when he found her, as well as a bag that he buried before bringing her back to the Grove. The ring contained the soul of her father, Adam Lee.

The bag contained a magic item created from a severed arm. The wrist of the arm would bleed anytime a "tempter demon" cake within range.

At the behest of her secretive father. Muspella led the group on a detour while making their way to the Bronze City to gain Intel on the orc invasion during the Grim War. She led them to Glandor to meet a lich named Victor Dark. It was her father's wish to cash in on old debts and be restored to life. It was during this that Muspella learned the truth of her father, he himself was a tempter demon.

On the way a rival demon caught the party's scent and made efforts to turn the party against each other, but the effort wasn't needed as Muspella, at the last moment, opted to destroy the ring that housed her father's penitent soul, rather than restore him to life.

With the ring destroyed, there was nothing protecting him from the forces of hell, and his soul was claimed by the Tempter Demon known as Charlie Zane.

Muspella would continue on without the guidance of her father, but for a time found her nights plagued by nightmares and her rage more difficult to control. This would lead her to slaughtering even more innocence and frequently lose her ability to distinguish right from wrong. Even advocating for the ruthless Grim Gash at the end of the Grim Wars.  

Tragedy would continue to follow Muspella as her adopted father, Gerald Stumpton, was lost to the Darkweed of the blight sister Betrayal. Despite her impulse to rush after him, she was convinced by the patient hand of Elder Precilla Oakborn to pursue taking down a shadowmen fort a little closer to home called "Twisted Knife"

Her efforts earned her the title of War Chief, and she led her Grove to victory. Along the way. Remi even discovered a way to cure the infection of Darkweed.

It was also discovered that Betrayal was in pursuit of a cave said to contain the natural born son of Myrcella Roudara and a Childers of Torquill Von Demillo.

Muspella's friends were called upon to continue their quest of purifying the Blight Sisters, while she pursued the cave. Surprisingly, she found it. Returning the preserved and paralyzed bodies of both to Mother's Grove. 

However, tragedy was not done with Muspella, and along the way she fell victim to her impulses once again and wandered away from camp in the dead of night... and was never seen again.

Hadriana and Remi heard the wail of a banshee just as their bond broke for the second time... though no trace of Muspella has been found the meaning is clear. Whatever led her to abandon her post and her Grove, she didn't survive the encounter.

Most assume she went looking for Gerald Stumpton and fell to Betrayal, but it was shortly after she vanished that strange creatures began attacking the druids of Roudgara forest.

We can only hope that whatever claimed her, doesn't do the same to Tiat Honorskull who set off on his own to save his old friend Gerald Stumpton.
